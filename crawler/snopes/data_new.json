I love the Spurs, and I once loved Coach Pop. But I am now questioning his respect for my country. I refuse to play while he continues to berate our president, my president on a national scale. I am tired of being constantly ridiculed by him about the person that I voted for. I felt it was time to take a stand. I hope and pray that you understand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is not a genuine quote from Kawhi Leonard. It does not appear in any <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/kawhi-leonard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">news</a> report <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/san-antonio-spurs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> in any credible publication. In fact, the fake quote appears to have originated with parody Facebook page “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackAdamSchefter/photos/a.408613425901711.1073741828.408320822597638/1757004341062606/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Adam Schefter</a>.” (Adam Schefter is a reporter for ESPN.)</p>\n<p>Leonard, who is recovering from a lingering quad injury, was not at the San Antonio Spurs’ first few playoff games in 2018, and there has been some <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/ailene-voisin/article209146934.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">speculation</a> that the NBA player is <a href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/04/whats-going-on-with-kawhi-leonard-a-strange-timeline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at odds</a> with the organization. The fictional phrase was likely created to take advantage of Spurs fans worried about the star’s future. </p>\n<p>This quote may have also seemed plausible as it was published on the heels of a report from the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/04/16/insulted-pro-trump-spurs-fans-feel-forced-to-choose-between-their-team-and-the-president/?utm_term=.ec9d05ae79ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Washington Post</a> </em>about how Popovich’s open criticism of President Donald Trump has turned off some Spurs fans:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since the presidential campaign, Popovich has shared his disdain for Trump. He has called the United States “an embarrassment to the world” and the president a “soulless coward” and a “pathological liar.” The veteran coach is disgusted by comments he called “xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic” — “and I live in a country where half the people ignored all that to elect someone. That’s the scariest part of the whole thing to me,” he said after the election.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>“It is sad that Pop basically told my wife and my son and me for that matter that we were fools for supporting Donald Trump,” he said. “What happens when someone calls you a fool? You avoid them.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>We attempted to find a genuine quote from Leonard about his coach’s politics, but have so far come up empty-handed. As far as we can tell, the soft-spoken NBA star has never weighed in on Popovich’s political views, nor he has offered up many of his own. Although we are not sure of where Kawhi Leonard lands on the political spectrum, the viral quote about his refusal to play for a coach who criticizes President Trump was completely invented.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/basketball/\">Basketball</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fake-quotes/\">fake quotes</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/san-antonio/\">san antonio</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">19 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Schwartz, Nick.   “What’s Going on With Kawhi Leonard: A Strange Timeline.”<br>\n    <em>USA Today</em>.   17 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Maese, Rick.   “‘Insulted’ Pro-Trump Spurs Fans Feel Forced to Choose Between Their Team and the President.”<br>\n    <em>Washington Post</em>.   16 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "276"},

The image appears to show a contestant on <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> seeking the help of the audience in identifying a description of “horsepower,” a question whose answer seemed obvious to many observers: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Equal to roughly 746 watts, what animal-based unit is used to measure the rate at which work is done?<br>\nA) Horsepower B) Donkeystrength C) Llamathrust D) Zebraforce</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Never forget.. 😂🤦‍♂️ <a href=\"https://t.co/86TAzdC2Qx\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/86TAzdC2Qx</a></p>\n<p>— WORLDSTARHIPHOP (@WORLDSTAR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WORLDSTAR/status/953406263232262144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">January 16, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>It would be unsurprising to learn that this image had been digitally edited or the audience poll superimposed for comic effect. However, this is in fact an authentic, undoctored photograph taken from a December 2014 episode of the popular, long-running quiz show. The moment first came to prominence in February 2015, when it was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2ul7wf/the_audience_is_dumb_the_answer_is_obviously/\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> to the /funny/ section of the online forum Reddit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-141879\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg?resize=600,339\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg?w=2688 2688w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg?resize=1024,579 1024w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg?resize=542,305 542w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/m8tn9vi.jpg?resize=375,211 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>However, the question also stood out for several social media users who watched an episode broadcast on 1 December 2014. Their photographs — each of which are different from the others — corroborate the authenticity of the one featured in the meme. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">C’mon Man – Who Wants To Be A Millionaire Edition.

Triston Cole (R- but a blog post <a href=\"https://archive.li/KfTkh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> on 16 April 2018 said:\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Michigan Republicans tried to pass a bill that would add a symbol, one option being A YELLOW STAR to LEGAL immigrants’ driver’s licenses. Not even a red star. A freaking yellow star, you know LIKE HITLER DID TO JEWS, only this one was a five point star so that’s okay…or something. Kind of perfect considering a new study showing two-thirds of millennials and 4 in 10 Americans don’t even know what Auschwitz is. One-third of Americans think fewer than six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, and over half of Americans think Hitler took power by force when he was actually democratically elected.</span></p>\n<p>So, the Michigan Republicans, another democratically elected group, just tried to put yellow stars on immigrants. Was it utter ignorance of history, has a Neo-Nazi troll managed to gain a position of power, or has everyone simply lost their goddamn freaking minds?</p></blockquote>\n<p>A 10 April 2018 <em>Detroit Free Press</em> <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/2018/04/10/michigan-drivers-license-immigrants/503450002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> was linked at the end of the post. It did not mention using a star on the license at any point, but an attached image included a sample Michigan license featuring a star:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/MI-gold-star-license.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-141525 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/MI-gold-star-license.jpg?w=500\" alt=\"MI gold star license\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/MI-gold-star-license.jpg?w=700 700w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/MI-gold-star-license.jpg?resize=300,225 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>That article reported on <a href=\"http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2017-2018/billanalysis/House/htm/2017-HLA-5686-FD0D9FB1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bills</a> proposing a “visual marker” on temporary immigrants” licenses, and quoted Cole as saying that there will not be any such requirement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The driver’s licenses for temporary immigrants will continue to have a “LT” on them to indicate they are “limited term.” But there won’t be any other visual marker or potentially misleading information about immigration status, said [Susan Reed, Managing Attorney for the Michigan Immigrants Rights Center.]</p>\n<p>State Rep. Triston Cole, chair of the transportation committee that approved of the bills, said the changes will help both immigrants and law enforcement. “There won’t be any” visual marker requirements now as had been mentioned in the original bill, he said.</p>\n<p>“This really streamlines the process and makes it easier for everyone,” Cole said.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the hearing [] before the vote to approve, Cole said: “I really want to thank those that helped to ensure that the verbiage was correct as we made these changes.”</p>\n<p>The main goal of the bills was to comply with the REAL ID act, he said. Passed by Congress in 2005, the REAL ID Act “established minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards,” says the Department of Homeland Security’s website.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/2018/04/10/bill-would-require-special-immigrant-drivers-licenses/485567002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> published on the same day by the same outlet noted that the use of “LT” on licenses began in 2013. As for the yellow star mentioned in the meme, that confusion seemed to stem from unrelated provisions under the 2005 <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/real-id-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REAL ID Act</a>. In September 2014, the <em>Boston Globe</em> <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/09/16/real-mass-must-take-steps-comply-with-problematic-law/HA1SCc1BRC9ynIN2QN1PiN/story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Under the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement schedule, the agency will soon require a REAL ID-compliant card to enter most federal buildings. As of 2016, Massachusetts licenses won’t be usable at the airport.</p>\n<p>The law sets forth 18 criteria for compliance. One criterion involves participating in a program called Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, which allows federal, state, and local benefit-issuing agencies to determine immigration and eligibility status of applicants. Also, employees issuing the licenses need special training, and compliant cards need to display a yellow star indicating Homeland Security’s approval.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As presented, the memes and blog post are mostly false. Although lawmakers in Michigan did propose a “visual marker” on the licenses of temporary immigrants, Cole most recently said there will not be any such designation on licenses. The bills mentioned in the meme were aimed at REAL ID Act compliance, and the yellow star is unrelated to immigration status. Under provisions of the 2005 legislation, the marking is in fact used to signal compliance with a Department of Homeland Security program.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">19 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ficca, Sarah.   “Michigan GOP Tried To Pass Bill Marking Immigrants’ Licenses With YELLOW STARS.”<br>\n    <em>Being Liberal</em>.   16 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Warikoo, Niraj.   “Michigan Immigrant Driver’s License Bill Changed After Complaints.”<br>\n    <em>Detroit Free Press</em>.   10 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Warikoo, Niraj.   “Michigan House Bill Would Mark Driver’s Licenses for Immigrants, Raising Fears of Profiling.”<br>\n    <em>Detroit Free Press</em>.   10 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Boston Globe</em>.   “Mass.

In reality, California Assembly Bill (A.B.) 2943 would not ban the sale of Bibles in that state.</p>\n<p>The clip from Wheeler’s interview with Allen can be viewed below. Here is a transcript of the most relevant section:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Wheeler:</strong>   This is essentially criminalizing religious beliefs. And I don’t mean to speak in hyperbole here, <em>but if this bill were to pass, would this prohibit the sale of the Bible</em>, that teaches these things about sexual morality?</p>\n<p><strong>Allen:</strong>   Well, <em>literally, according to how this law is written, yes, it would</em>. This is, you know, PC culture, politically correct culture, gone horribly awry. This is really directly hitting at our First Amendment rights as American citizens. Now the Democrat legislators in this building, right behind me, the California state legislature, they want to tell you how to think, what sort of books that you can read, write and purchase.</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XLtRDoerVUw\" width=\"600\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></center></blockquote>\n<p>California Assembly Bill 2943 does not mention the Bible, Christianity, or religion at all, so when Allen claimed that the legislation would “literally” prohibit the sale of the Bible, he was stating something that is demonstrably and clearly false.</p>\n<p>In reality the legislation, which was introduced in February 2018 by San Jose-based Democrat Evan Low, enhances California’s already-existing prohibition on “sexual orientation change efforts” (SOCE), commonly known as “gay conversion therapy.” In 2012, the California Assembly passed <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1172\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Bill 1172</a>, which banned mental health professionals from performing SOCE on children under the age of 18. The law defines SOCE as: “any practices by mental health providers that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.”</p>\n<p>A.B. 2943, as it <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2943\" target=\"_blank\">stood</a> on 20 April 2018, would extend that earlier prohibition in the following ways:</p>\n<ul><li>Prohibit SOCE from being performed on anyone, not only children under the age of 18</li>\n<li>Prohibit the advertising or sale of SOCE as a service</li>\n</ul><p>The bill also appears to prohibit SOCE from being performed by any individual, not just by mental health providers, but the Assembly Judiciary Committee’s <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2943\" target=\"_blank\">analysis</a> notes it is not clear whether the text of A.B. 2943 would amount to a blanket prohibition on any and all SOCE. </p>\n<p>Anthony Samson, a Sacramento attorney and policy advisor told us by email that the bill would prohibit conversion therapy “as a commercial service in exchange for monetary compensation,” adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It does not apply to the sale of books or any other kind of goods, and it does not prevent anyone from speaking or writing on the subject of conversion therapy in any forum. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Low’s bill does not seek to outlaw all religious or moral instruction regarding sexuality and sexual orientation, nor would it ban the sale or possession of generic religious texts such as the Bible. Christian dogma might form the basis of efforts change a person’s sexual orientation, but the Bible itself is not a “gay conversion therapy” manual.</p>\n<p>The text of the <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2943\" target=\"_blank\">legislation</a> cites rafts of clinical evidence which conclude that SOCE is not a legitimate treatment because it seeks to “treat” same-sex attraction (something that is not classified as a mental illness) and because it can cause harm to the patient.</p>\n<p>In 2009, the American Psychological Association published the results of a major two-year task force review of peer-reviewed research about SOCE, which <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">concluded</a> by noting that “Efforts to change sexual orientation are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates.” The review recommended that mental health providers, faced with an individual who wants to change sexual orientation, should implement a therapy based on “acceptance, support, and understanding” but should not “[impose] a specific sexual orientation identity outcome.”</p>\n<p>In April 2018, Low — who is openly gay — made an emotional speech before the California Assembly, recounting his own past struggle with his sexual orientation and describing the anxiety and even suicidal thoughts he had wrestled with:</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JbvyElnyEGE\" width=\"600\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block;

After a bitter 2016 presidential campaign in which candidate Donald Trump heavily criticized two of Barbara Bush’s sons (as well as beating out Jeb Bush for the Republican nomination), the Bush family matriarch made it no secret that she was not a fan of Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>We uncovered no other reports that anyone from the Bush family “ordered” the sitting president not to attend Barbara Bush’s memorial service. Instead, the White House released a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/19/us/politics/ap-us-trump-bush.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> to reporters saying Trump would not attend out of respect to avoid creating a disruption “due to added security.” First Lady Melania Trump, however, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43839659\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will be</a> in attendance, as will former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and former first ladies Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama (along with, of course, Barbara Bush’s husband and sons).</p>\n<p>During the 2016 campaign, Barbara Bush didn’t hold back in her critiques of then-candidate Donald Trump. In the course of a CNN interview, for example, she proclaimed that “[Trump] doesn’t give many answers to how he would solve problems. He sort of makes faces and says insulting things … He’s said terrible things about women, terrible things about the military. I don’t understand why people are for him, for that reason. I’m a woman … I’m not crazy about what he says about women.”</p>\n<p>In another interview with CBS, Bush again lambasted Trump for his comments about women and called him a “comedian” or a “showman”:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Surprised this didn’t get shared more at the time.

These photographs were taken on the set of the Syrian movie “فيلم رجل الثورة” or <em>Revolution Man</em>, and they have been on the Internet since at least 24 February 2018 (more than a month before the alleged chemical attack in Douma) when they were posted to the movie’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/993146510832449/photos/a.993174074163026.1073741828.993146510832449/998307810316319/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> page.</p>\n<p>The belief that the White Helmets or similar groups are staging chemical attacks in Syria is not one exclusively held by conspiracy theorists or the uninformed. It is parroting Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad’s line that crisis actors were used to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/middleeast/assad-syria-video-faked.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stage</a> a terrorist attack in April 2017 and claims that a photograph of a young child in the aftermath of an airstrike on Aleppo had been <a href=\"http://time.com/4538448/omran-daqneesh-bashar-assad-syria-aleppo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forged</a>. Assad’s regime also denied using chemical weapons in Douma. </p>\n<p><em>Revolution Man</em> pushes a similar idea. A news report from <em><a href=\"https://sana.sy/en/?p=129818\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sana</a> </em>about the premiere of the film, which was supported by the Syrian Cultural Ministry, explained that the movie is about a photojournalist who resorts to staging a chemical attack in an effort to win a Pulitzer Prize after he sneaks into Syria to take <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/Revolution-Man-Movie-%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-993146510832449/about/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photographs</a> of the war:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/revolution-man.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-141536\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/revolution-man.jpg?resize=600,900\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/revolution-man.jpg?w=1366 1366w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/revolution-man.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/revolution-man.jpg?resize=768,1151 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/revolution-man.jpg?resize=683,1024 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><br></a>The film revolves around a journalist who enters Syria illegally in order to take pictures and videos of the war in Syria in search of fame and international prizes, and after failing to reach his goal, he resorts to helping the terrorists to fabricate an incident using chemical materials, with the aim of turning his photos into a global event.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, photographs from a film set about a man staging a chemical attack are being used by conspiracy theorists (and <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/04/13/doumafakenews/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russian state media</a>) as evidence that a chemical attack was actually staged.

What set Fitzsimons apart from other recently deceased persons, the blog suggested, was that the deputy “took to social media to question the potential agenda” behind the assault at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a mass shooting that resulted in the deaths of 17 people and spurred an uptick in gun safety protests around the U.S. </p>\n<p>That suggestion was based on a social media post by Fitzsimons depicting one of the high school’s students, David Hogg, in a Nazi uniform: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-David-Hogg-post.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-David-Hogg-post.jpg?resize=600,549\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-141065\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-David-Hogg-post.jpg?w=600 600w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-David-Hogg-post.jpg?resize=300,275 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>According to the Memory Hole Blog, that post and all of Fitzsimons’ other social posts from 2018 had been “scrubbed”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As is suggested in the aftermath of other recent mass shooting events, Fitzsimons simply may have possessed too much information, was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and/or asking sensitive questions of his peers and superiors on the specifics of the Parkland shooting. It is beyond dispute that the sheriff’s deputy had become uncomfortably outspoken on the February 14 event.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other conservative blogs picked up the story, with one saying that Fitsimons had “exposed” a conspiracy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-YourNewsWire.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-YourNewsWire.jpg?resize=600,324\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-141830\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-YourNewsWire.jpg?w=600 600w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/Jason-Fitzsimons-YourNewsWire.jpg?resize=300,162 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>But these blogs did not mention Memory Hole’s <a href=\"http://memoryholeblog.org/2018/04/13/jason-fitzsimons-social-media-activity/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">follow-up</a> story, which noted that Fitzsimons had used several different <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=jason%20fitzsimons\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> accounts, and that the account featuring the post criticizing Hogg had not been “scrubbed” and was accessible online at press time.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the Broward County Sheriffs Department told us that they did not consider Fitzsimons’ death to be suspicious. We also contacted the county medical examiners’ office, who said only that Fitzsimons’ case was pending.  The sheriffs’ department spokesperson confirmed to us that detectives were aware of Fitzsimons’ controversial social media post about Hogg, adding, “It has nothing to do with his death.”  </p>\n<p>Since the Parkland shooting, Hogg has been the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/02/20/right-wing-media-david-hogg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">target</a> of a series of smears promoted by far-right blogs attempting to discredit him and his activist efforts for gun safety. Mike Adams, the founder of an “alternative health” blog, went so far as to found an entirely new site devoted to labeling Hogg a “<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/04/16/natural-news-creator-site-parkland-survivor/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fascist</a>,” among other pejoratives.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources no-sources\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">18 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "292"},

Those three members — East Bay Ray, Klaus Fluoride, and D.H. Peligro — sued Biafra to recover unpaid royalties as well as to maintain rights over the band’s musical catalog. The case was acrimonious and both sides tell <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67364/biafra-drops-suit-against-ex-bandmates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">different stories</a> about what ultimately lead to the breakdown in the former band members’ relationship.</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>The bulk of <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/525ed589e4b07b05fff51e46/t/55089f4ae4b0da6f16e59afe/1426628426187/Dead+Kennedys+1st+District+COA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the case</a> alleged that Biafra, in his capacity as the owner of the record label that distributed the Dead Kennedys’ music, owed the rest of the band royalties from the sales of those albums. Two record labels were involved: Decay Music, which was formed in 1981 by the four members of the Dead Kennedys as an equal partnership; and Alternative Tentacles Records, which was founded by Ray, Biafra, and another man in 1981. The Dead Kennedys released their first album on Alternative Tentacles, but after that it was a label used for non-Dead Kennedy projects.</p>\n<p>In 1984, Decay Music (which comprised all four members of the Dead Kennedys) gave the rights to distribute Dead Kennedy music to Alternative Tentacles Records (which, by 1987, included only Biafra as an owner). The 1998 suit alleged two major failings on the part of Biafra: that as director of Alternative Tentacles he underpaid the other band members by raising the retail price of the records without increasing the royalty calculation, and that he failed to properly advertise or promote the band’s old catalog, leading the other members of the band to receive less revenue than they should have if Alternative Tentacles had been run properly.</p>\n<p>A February 2000 <a href=\"http://www.deadkennedysnews.com/art020100.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> in <i>Spin</i> describes a lack of formal legal agreements that made the case challenging to handicap at the time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since the band’s business with Alternative Tentacles was mostly cemented with punk-rock handshakes rather than legal documents, it’s going to be hard to prove who’s right.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2003, after a jury trial and an appeal, Biafra lost the case and was forced to pay $220,000 to his former bandmates — both for unpaid royalties and for fraud. In <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67364/biafra-drops-suit-against-ex-bandmates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2004</a>, Biafra dropped a countersuit against the remaining members (who now tour without him), giving the rights to the Dead Kennedys’ former catalog to Decay Music.</p>\n<p>In interviews from during and after the trial, Biafra alleged that this dispute was not about the money itself (he <a href=\"https://www.popmatters.com/biafra-jello-2496107737.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">says</a> the royalty issue was an accounting error that they were working to resolve before the case even began), and he instead framed the issue as an objection to his former band members “selling out.”</p>\n<p>In a claim repeated many times (and disputed to this day), Biafra <a href=\"https://www.popmatters.com/biafra-jello-2496107737.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleges</a> that things soured between the bandmates when Biafra vetoed using their song “Holiday in Cambodia” in a Levi’s commercial:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Ray] went to two of my closest friends [Fluoride and Peligro] asking them to “persuade” me to sell out to Levi’s. When I asked about this and reminded him of what would happen to our reputation if this went through […] he said, “Why don’t you just go to the press and tell them we did it for charity?” Five percent to charity and keep the rest of the money. That’s what he wanted me to. I didn’t and they sued. They claim it was the accounting error that sparked the lawsuit, but we were all trying to settle that together. Until I wouldn’t do [the Levi’s commercial].</p></blockquote>\n<p>“They’re punishing me for sticking to the principles of the band and underground, independent culture,” Biafra <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dead-kennedys-beat-jello-20030619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">argued</a> when he lost the jury trial. In a 2003 <i>Rolling Stone </i><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dead-kennedys-beat-jello-20030619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a>, Fluoride argued that it was merely about recognizing the equality of decision making over their old catalog:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We wanted Biafra to recognize our vote in how we wanted our music released […] No one seemed to understand that by Dead Kennedys and Decay Music controlling our own catalog, Jello still gets 100% of his record royalties and his music publishing, which is exactly what he is entitled to. We just wanted an equal say in all matters that pertained to the band.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The other three Dead Kennedys have <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67364/biafra-drops-suit-against-ex-bandmates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consistently</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/oct/11/owenadams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">denied</a> that any dispute over licensing a song for a Levi’s ad played a role in bringing their lawsuit to trial, and have stated their belief that the argument was a “smokescreen” to hide the financial fraud committed by Biafra.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, neither the court nor the jury were asked to rule on what initially caused the litigants to move to trial, and we were not there when the alleged incident happened.

Was not young children who did this!</p></blockquote>\n<p>This text claims that this photograph was taken at the “Tomb of the Unknown Soldier” at the Veterans Plaza in Longview, Texas. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, however, is located at the <a href=\"https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Tomb-of-the-Unknown-Soldier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arlington National Cemetery</a> in Virginia. There is a <a href=\"http://www.vetplaza.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Veterans Plaza</a> in Longview, Texas, but none of the monuments at this memorial carry that name.</p>\n<p>The <em><a href=\"https://www.news-journal.com/news/police/veterans-plaza-statue-destroyed-at-teague-park-in-longview/article_74351397-4cc1-59d5-a24e-7d0a724083a8.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Longview Journal</a>,</em> one of the first outlets to report on the statue’s fate, noted the mistake in Applewhite’s post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Officials with the group who oversees the plaza later said the destroyed statue is not that of the Unknown Soldier, but that it represents every service member.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The claim that this statue was “pushed over by vandals” and that those alleged vandals were “not young children” is also unverified. Local police officers were reportedly <a href=\"http://www.cbs19.tv/article/news/local/veteran-monument-found-vandalized-in-longview/436635515\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigating</a> the incident as an act of vandalism, but we have encountered no reports about an arrest related to this statue’s destruction, nor any photographs or video showing the alleged vandals knocking the statue over. </p>\n<p>It also appears that the claim that this was an act of vandalism was merely an unverified assumption. We reached out to the Longview Police Department and were told that the investigation was ended due to a lack of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We did investigate but had no information or leads and so at this point the case has been suspended.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sergeant R. Shane McCarter confirmed to us that a suspect was never identified but added that the police department believed the statue was intentionally toppled:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The statue was replaced by the Veterans Recognition Foundation. The suspect was not identified nor have there been any witnesses to identify the suspect. We did take the report as a criminal mischief and do believe it was an intentional act.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although this statue may have truly been vandalized, it’s also <a href=\"http://texashillcountry.com/statue-unknown-soldier-pushed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">possible</a> that it was an accident or the inevitable result of a structural weakness:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any news on who could have ruined the statue, nor if this was definitely an act of vandalism. Some are speculating that it could have been the result of a structural failure in a weak part of the sculpture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Regardless of how this statue met its demise, it was <a href=\"https://www.news-journal.com/news/local/group-pays-to-replace-vandalized-longview-veterans-plaza-statue/article_030a0e9f-b15f-571c-b3a1-c4bb4be7de6e.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">replaced</a> within a few months:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It troubled Tim Hood when he read reports of a statue destroyed by vandals at an entrance to the Veterans Plaza at Longview’s Teague Park.</p>\n<p>The grand vice chancellor of the Longview lodge of the Knights of Pythias is not a veteran, but like many in his shoes, he respects the Americans who defended his freedom and are honored in the walk-through memorial.</p>\n<p>“We had a meeting that night, so I took it to the lodge,” Hood said Friday morning after handing the fruits of that discussion — a $1,000 check — to Veterans Recognition Foundation leaders Billy Clay and Gail Jurkowski.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have reached out to the Veterans Recognition Foundation, the organization in charge of the Veterans Plaza, for more information. </p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/nontroversies/\">nontroversies</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/statues/\">statues</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/texas/\">texas</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier/\">tomb of the unknown soldier</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/tomb-unknown-soldier-arlington-national-cemetery-1516768\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Maehl / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">17 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">19 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Longview Journal</em>.   “Veterans Plaza Statue Destroyed at Teague Park in Longview.”<br>\n    2 May 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Texas Hill Country</em>.   “Statue of the Unknown Soldier Possibly Pushed Down in Park in Longview.”<br>\n    4 May 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hardy, Tristan.   “Veteran Monument Found Vandalized in Longview.”<br>\n    <em>CBS 19</em>.   3 May 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "194"},

So when a piece of highly edited footage purportedly showing Mark Zuckerberg announcing that he was closing the Facebook social media network started to spread online, many viewers came thinking that it might be real:</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<blockquote><p>\n<strong>Hey everyone, Zuck here with a huge announcement. So after much consideration … I, the Zuck man himself, will be deleting Facebook.</strong></p>\n<p><iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADCPqE4ShGQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADCPqE4ShGQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></noscript>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although this footage may look pretty convincing, several aspects give away that the video is a hoax.</p>\n<p>For starters, this video did not originate from Mark Zuckerberg’s official <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook page</a>, nor any other <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pages</a> officially <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">associated</a> with the company. </p>\n<p>As well, this video was created by Bayview Drive Films and was originally posted to their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADCPqE4ShGQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a> page on 1 April 2018 (April Fool’s Day).

The 14-year-old girl told her 1.3 million subscribers that she “didn’t use protection” and “didn’t want to get him in trouble” so she plans to have an abortion.</p>\n<p>Rather than just get one like liberal women do every time they get pregnant, Stacey Rhodes says she wants “to use her situation to do some good.” What kind of good, you ask?

The flight was to be a short transfer for him en route to a talk he was about to give concerning a paper he had recently co-authored. </p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>As Menzio sat waiting for the rest of the passengers to board the plane, he began to work through a series of differential equations — complex-looking equations commonly used by those who mathematically model systems such as national economies. Menzio rebuffed an effort at small talk from the passenger next to him, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2016/05/07/ivy-league-economist-interrogated-for-doing-math-on-american-airlines-flight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according</a> to the <i>Washington Post:</i>  “Is Syracuse home? She asked. No, he replied curtly. He similarly deflected further questions. He appeared laser-focused — perhaps too laser-focused — on the task at hand, those strange scribblings.”</p>\n<p>Following this interaction between Menzio and his seatmate, the plane remained on the tarmac for a lengthy period of time before being ordered to return to the gate, at which point the passenger next to Menzio — who had complained she felt ill — was escorted away. Shortly afterwards, Menzio was also escorted off the plane and informed by a gate agent that the woman sitting next to him had expressed concerns about his curt behavior and suspicious scribbling, suggesting he could perhaps be a terrorist:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nAnd then the big reveal: The woman wasn’t really sick at all! Instead this quick-thinking traveler had Seen Something, and so she had Said Something.</p>\n<p>That Something she’d seen had been her seatmate’s cryptic notes, scrawled in a script she didn’t recognize. Maybe it was code, or some foreign lettering, possibly the details of a plot to destroy the dozens of innocent lives aboard American Airlines Flight 3950. She may have felt it her duty to alert the authorities just to be safe. The curly-haired man was, the agent informed him politely, suspected of terrorism.</p>\n<p>The curly-haired man laughed.</p>\n<p>He laughed because those scribbles weren’t Arabic, or another foreign language, or even some special secret terrorist code. They were math.</p>\n<p>Yes, <em>math</em>. A differential equation, to be exact.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Menzio was allowed to return to the plane after American Airline agents determined he posed no threat, while the passenger who reported him was re-booked onto another flight. The incident drew serious viral attention and outrage at the time, in part due to the belief that Menzio “<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/economist-profiled-after-doing-math-on-plane.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">looked</a>” Middle Eastern and was profiled by the other passenger for this reason. </p>\n<p>This tale continues to be spread in <a href=\"http://archive.is/LITGj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meme</a> form years after the fact.

A young man living in a French farming village in the 1950s undergoes an extraordinary growth spurt and becomes too ungainly to ride the bus to school. A neighbor with a convertible automobile steps in to help. The adult and the young man strike up an unlikely friendship on their morning car journeys, discussing the game of cricket and other subjects as they form a special bond with each other.</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>The older man with the car? He was Samuel Beckett, the Irish playwright and author of <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. The boy? André Roussimoff, who would eventually grow to a height of more than seven feet and become famous as André the Giant, a global superstar and icon in the world professional wrestling.</p>\n<p>It’s one of pop culture’s most bizarre and cherished “chance encounter” tales. But is it true?</p>\n<p>The story, in its rudiments, has been around for years, but it has most prominently been told by Cary Elwes, the English actor who played Westley in the 1987 film <em>The Princess Bride</em> and became close with André (who played Fezzik) during the production of that movie.</p>\n<p>In his voiceover commentary to accompany behind-the-scenes footage of <em>The Princess Bride</em> released as a DVD extra in 2000, Elwes told the Samuel Beckett story as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ll tell you an interesting story about André. You know that he couldn’t fit on the school bus on the way to school. He told me this. So he had to be driven, in a car, to school every morning. And his parents couldn’t afford one, but his neighbor had a big car and his neighbor used to drive him to school every day.</p>\n<p>I said “Oh really?” He said “Oh yes, he was a very nice man … you may have heard of him, I don’t know.” I said “Really? What’s his name.” He goes, “Samuel Becket.” Samuel Beckett used to drive him to school every day! I mean, “Waiting for André.”</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gkRTha6C3g\" width=\"600\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></center></blockquote>\n<p>Elwes recounted the story in greater detail in his 2014 memoir <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=lPptAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales From the Making of the Princess Bride</a></em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As the shoot continued I began to spend more and more time with [André]. And slowly he began to open up to me about his life. He told me he had two brothers and two sisters and that he was the middle child. That he grew up on a farm built by his father, Boris, in the small village of Molien, which was about forty miles from Paris.</p>\n<p>He told me that by the time he was twelve he had already grown to a height of six feet two and 240 pounds and that he was so big that he could no longer ride on the local bus that transported the other children to school.</p>\n<p>Sometime after that, the great Irish playwright, Samuel Beckett, bought some land in Molien and decided to move there (there is still a street named after him.) Being a handyman as well as a farmer, Roussimoff Sr. offered to help Beckett build his country cottage and eventually the two struck up a friendship. When the playwright learned of young André’s issues with the school bus, he offered to drive the boy to school, explaining that he had a convertible — the only one in town — and thus, the only vehicle that could possibly accommodate André’s size.</p>\n<p>And so, for a time at least, the Nobel Prize-winning author of Waiting for Godot chauffeured the young man who would eventually become the most famous wrestler in history to and from school … I asked André what he and the famous author talked about when they were together. “Mostly cricket,” André recalled.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The odd friendship between the two has captured the imagination for years and has inspired fictionalized portrayals in works such as a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Andre-Giant-Legend-Box-Brown/dp/1596438517\" target=\"_blank\">graphic novel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6421548/\" target=\"_blank\">short film</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/theater/review-sam-dede-2-giants-forming-an-unlikely-bond.html\" target=\"_blank\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/217053\" target=\"_blank\">plays</a>.</p>\n<p>The story is plausible on its face. Beckett did live near the Roussimoffs in Molien, a tiny hamlet in the town of Ussy-sur-Marne near Paris, from 1953 to 1960, when André was between the ages of seven and 14. </p>\n<p>According to an essay by the leading Beckett expert James Knowlson, at that time the Irishman did <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=13TIMIFZHKYC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=beckett+molien+driving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCs-ezwsTaAhUoVd8KHfnuDHkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=beckett%20molien%20driving&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">drive</a> a Citröen 2CV, which was a convertible. Beckett was also a great fan of cricket, once a serious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/21/samuel-beckett-sportsman\" target=\"_blank\">player</a> himself.</p>\n<p>However, the April 2018 release of a documentary feature film about the wrestler, who died in 1993, brought the legend under renewed scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Jason Hehir, the director of <em>André the Giant</em>, was asked about the Beckett story in interviews surrounding the release of the film on HBO, telling <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/andre-the-giant-director-breaks-down-memorable-scenes-2018-4#why-isnt-the-famous-samuel-beckett-drove-andre-to-school-story-in-the-movie-4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Business Insider</em></a> that the tale as commonly related was somewhat exaggerated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Beckett’s house is a few hundred yards down the road from Andre’s childhood home, that is true. The reality is there was no bus to school in that town. There was a 2-kilometer walk from Andre’s house into the center of town, where the schoolhouse was, and all the kids in the village took that walk to and from school every day. Andre’s father had no hand in helping to build Samuel Beckett’s house.</p>\n<p>Beckett had a truck, and if he passed the kids, he would stop and let them hop into the flatbed of his truck and he would drive them to or from school. But it wasn’t singular to Andre, and he had no special relationship with Andre any more than he did with any other child in that area. Andre’s brother laughed at us when we told him what the legend is.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We got in touch with Hehir, who sent us an excerpt from the transcript of his interview with Antoine Roussimoff, a brother of André. Roussimoff said Beckett, along with other local adults, sometimes gave car rides to schoolchildren, but not exclusively to André, and not because he had outgrown the school bus. “There was no bus,” Antoine told the filmmakers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For us to go to school, we had to travel two and a half kilometers by foot in the morning and back in the evening.  Every day. And sometimes there’d be a gentleman or a lady who drove by who knew us … who had us get in the car, and then brought us either to school, or in the opposite direction, to take us back at home. </p>\n<p>Mr. Beckett, he did that with everybody, with me as well as with my sisters.  There were also other people, other farmers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Roussimoff also put paid to the legend that his father had helped build Beckett’s house for him, saying: “We had nothing to do with Mr. Beckett. Absolutely nothing. My parents, they knew him when they would run into each other, that’s all.”</p>\n<p>Similarly, Roussimoff dismissed a separate story that André was forced to leave school later in his teenage years because he could no longer be accommodated in the schoolhouse, such was his size:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My brother didn’t leave school because he was too big. He left school because he was fourteen years old.  He had reached the age when you could leave school. I don’t understand why people tell stories like that, that André left school because he was too big. That’s not true. </p>\n<p>It’s like Mr. Beckett, or like the bus that didn’t want to take him to school because he was too tall, that he couldn’t fit in the bus. It’s false. There was no bus. So, that’s not true … Mr. Beckett would take André to school every day? That’s false. That’s not true. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In an email, Hehir told us that André’s other brother and one of André’s childhood friends had both corroborated the version of events provided by Antoine Roussimoff, adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the interesting aspects of the mythology surrounding André is that he himself perpetuated so much of it. This Beckett story is a good example. According to Cary Elwes, André himself told the story of his friendship with Beckett. He would also tell interviewers that he was from Grenoble and that his grandfather was nearly eight feet tall. Again, both false. It’s a testament to the extraordinary life André lived that we have difficulty deciphering truth from fiction.</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">18 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Elwes, Cary and Joe Layden.   <em>As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of the Princess Bride</em>.<br>\n    <em>Simon and Schuster</em>, 2014.   ISBN 1-476-76402-6.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Knowlson, James.   “A Writer’s Homes — A Writer’s Life.”<br>\n  in <em>A Companion to Samuel Beckett</em><br>\n    Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.   ISBN 1-405-15869-7.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Knowlson, James.   “Samuel Beckett the Sportsman — From Cricket to Krapp’s Last Tape.”<br>\n    <em>The Guardian</em>.   21 August 2012.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Guerrasio, Jason.   “The Director of HBO’s André the Giant Documentary Explains How He Debunked Some Major Myths and Got Vince McMahon to Cry.”<br>\n    <em>Business Insider</em>.   11 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "143"},

Although Albert Einstein didn’t actually <a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2008/mar/18-chain-reaction-from-einstein-to-the-atomic-bomb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">develop</a> the atom bomb, his work did make such a device possible:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Albert Einstein did not work directly on the atom bomb. But Einstein was the father of the bomb in two important ways: 1) it was his initiative which started U.S. bomb research; 2) it was his equation (E = mc2) which made the atomic bomb theoretically possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His work was so entwined with the development of nuclear weapons that <em><a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19460701,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Time</a> </em>featured a picture of Einstein on their July 1946 cover, in front of an explosion with the equation “E=mc²” written in the mushroom cloud:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/einstein-nuclear-bombs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-139084\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/einstein-nuclear-bombs.jpg?resize=600,790\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/einstein-nuclear-bombs.jpg?w=400 400w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/einstein-nuclear-bombs.jpg?resize=228,300 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Einstein was, in other words, well aware of how nuclear weapons could affect the world.  However, although he did repeatedly warn the world about the dangers of nuclear weapons, this quote doesn’t appear to be an exact record of the physicist’s words and even the earliest records appear to be anecdotal. In March 1947, reports <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/30745506/?terms=einstein+world+war+iV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appeared</a> about an exchange that Einstein reportedly had with a group of friends at a dinner party:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Professor Albert Einstein was asked by friends at a recent dinner party what new weapons might be employed in World War III. Appalled at the implications, he shook his head.</p>\n<p>After several minutes of meditation, he said. “I don’t know what weapons might be used in World War III. But there isn’t any doubt what weapons will be used in World War IV.”</p>\n<p>“And what are those?” a guest asked.</p>\n<p>“Stone spears,” said Einstein.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Although these reports appear to be more anecdotal than factual, an account of Einstein saying something similar is reportedly documented in the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1949, </span><em style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Liberal Judaism </em><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">published an interview entitled “Einstein at 70” between Einstein and his contemporary Alfred Werner, which purportedly contains a similar </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&amp;q=rocks#v=snippet&amp;q=rocks&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exchange</a>. </p>\n<p>Even if Einstein expressed this exact sentiment, he was not the first to do so. In September 1946, more than six months before the quote was first attributed to Einstein, a reporter attributed this <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/9200694/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quip</a> to an unnamed Army lieutenant:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Joe Laitin reports that reporters at Bikini were questioning an Army Lt. about what weapons would be used in the next war. I dunno, he said, but in the war after the next war, sure as hell, they’ll be using spears!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Einstein may have been paraphrasing something he had heard earlier during his interview with Werner — or this may simply be an anecdote relaying the physicist’s attitude toward nuclear weapons. Einstein was, after all, a signatory on the Russel-Einstein Manifesto, which <a href=\"https://pugwash.org/1955/07/09/statement-manifesto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> about the potentially world-altering devastation of nuclear weaponry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is stated on very good authority that a bomb can now be manufactured which will be 2,500 times as powerful as that which destroyed Hiroshima.</p>\n<p>Such a bomb, if exploded near the ground or under water, sends radio-active particles into the upper air. They sink gradually and reach the surface of the earth in the form of a deadly dust or rain. It was this dust which infected the Japanese fishermen and their catch of fish.</p>\n<p>No one knows how widely such lethal radio-active particles might be diffused, but the best authorities are unanimous in saying that a war with H-bombs might possibly put an end to the human race.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We found several other instances of people making <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/276854393/?terms=world+war+iv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similar</a> <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/31055994/?terms=third+world+war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statements</a> at around the same time, indicating that this was a popular opinion at that time that was evidently shared by Albert Einstein. However, we have been unable to find a direct quote from the physicist that matches this particular meme.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/albert-einstein/\">albert einstein</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/nuclear-weapons/\">nuclear weapons</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/world-war-iii/\">world war III</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/world-war-iv/\">world war iv</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Albert_Einstein_1947.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Oren Jack Turner / Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">16 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">18 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Croucher, Shane.   “World War 3 Google Searches Spike After Trump Launches Syria Missile Strike.”<br>\n    <em>Newsweek</em>.   16 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Isaacson, Walter.   “Chain Reaction: From Einstein to the Atomic Bomb.”<br>\n    <em>Discovery Magazine</em>.   18 March 2008.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>The Berkshire Eagle</em>.   “‘Stone Age’ Forecast Made by Einstein.”<br>\n    18 March 1948.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Princeton University Press</em>.   “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein.”<br>\n    11 October 2010.

Some of them were clearly designed to corrode and undermine the credibility of the investigation and the integrity of those perceived as being hostile or potentially damaging to President Trump, including former Federal Bureau of Investivation director James Comey, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and those surrounding her, and several other Department of Justice officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. </p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>One particular theory — although it is more a cluster of speculation and innuendo than a coherent theory — went one step further, targeting former Justice Department lawyer and attorney for the National Institutes for Health Lisa Barsoomian, who is also Rod Rosenstein’s wife.</p>\n<p>Conspiracy theorists have been speculating and alleging that a shadowy “deep state” conspiracy has forced records of and references to Barsoomian (supposedly a secret Clinton loyalist) be “purged” from the Internet. In reality, there are ample references to Barsoomian throughout the internet, and her record as an attorney remains well documented in court records over the past two decades. </p>\n<p>Those alleging conspiracies and conflicts of interest in the fact that Barsoomian has acted as an attorney for former United States President Bill Clinton appear to understand little about the nature of a government attorney’s work — or else to be deliberately misrepresenting that reality. In March 2018, the conspiracy theorist web site Patriots4Truth.org <a href=\"http://archive.is/tB0SO\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Barsoomian…represented Bill Clinton in 1998…<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">You may be saying to yourself, okay who cares, who cares about the work history of this Barsoomian woman? </span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Apparently someone does BECAUSE :  Someone out there cares so much that they’ve “purged” all Barsoomian court documents for her Clinton representation in Hamburg vs. Clinton in 1998 and its appeal in 1999 from the DC District and Appeals court dockets (?) </span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Someone out there cares so much that the internet has been “purged” of all information pertaining to Barsoomian. </span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Historically this indicates that the individual is a protected CIA operative.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Nobody has “purged all Barsoomian court documents” relating to her role in the 1998 case Hamburg vs. Clinton. This is false. It took us only a few minutes to find that case on a court records database and locate a document written and signed by Barsoomian. </p>\n<p>In 1998, a Wyoming military veteran named Al Hamburg — an eccentric “perennial candidate” and letter-writer who once attempted to register his <a href=\"http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wyoming-s-perennial-candidate-al-hamburg-dies/article_3f7d956e-fe67-5232-acce-30a6f3f463b5.html\" target=\"_blank\">dog</a> as a presidential candidate — filed a civil rights case against Clinton in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief.  Hamburg <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2018/04/hamburg_clinton_complaint.pdf\">alleged</a> anti-white discrimination by Clinton and claimed that the president was part of a conspiracy to bring about an “alien invasion” by Mexican-American military members. He demanded an upgrade to his Vietnam-era “undesirable discharge” from the Army, along with three months’ pay allegedly due to him since 1967, and “at least ten thousand dollars.”</p>\n<p>Clinton’s <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2018/04/clinton_response_hamburg.pdf\">response</a> to Hamburg’s claims is signed by several Justice department officials — including Barsoomian, who was acting in her capacity as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. The case was quickly dismissed by a judge. </p>\n<p>Far from being the smoking gun in an elaborate, decades-long conspiracy, Barsoomian’s role in the case singled out by the conspiracy theorists was utterly mundane, routine, and entirely in keeping with the ordinary course of her job as an attorney in the Department of Justice. The spurious, factually inaccurate claim appears to have originated in a June 2017 blog <a href=\"http://archive.is/ZpWoA\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> written by the controversial conservative political consultant Roger Stone, who was briefly Trump’s campaign manager in 2015. On his web site, Stone wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lisa Barsoomian works for R. Craig Lawrence, an attorney who has represented Robert Mueller three times, James Comey five times, Barack Obama forty-five times, Kathleen Sebellius fifty-six times, Bill Clinton forty times, and Hillary Clinton seventeen times between 1991 and 2017.</p>\n<p>Barsoomian participated in some of this work personally and has herself represented the FBI at least five separate times.  It would be great to research the specifics of the cases she worked in, many of the documents from the Court Docket relating to these cases have been removed from the D.C. District and Appeals Court, including her representation for Clinton in 1998’s case Hamburg. V. Clinton.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What is especially notable about this particular line of argument is its insidious misrepresentation of the work of a government attorney. </p>\n<p>Neither Barsoomian nor Lawrence were acting as attorneys in private practice, and neither represented Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, anyone else in a personal capacity. As United States attorneys, it would at times have been part of their job to act in court on behalf of the President of the United States and other government officials, departments and agencies. </p>\n<p>Naturally, this also extends to Republican politicians, appointees and Republican-run agencies and departments, something that Stone and other conspiracy theorists fail to mention. As part of their Justice Department duties, Barsoomian and Lawrence also defended — among others — Colin Powell, John Ashcroft, and Tom Ridge, all Republicans appointed by former President George W. Bush. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/conspiracy-theories/\">conspiracy theories</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/lisa-barsoomian/\">lisa barsoomian</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/patriots4truth/\">patriots4truth</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+5 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/robert-mueller/\">robert mueller</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/rod-rosenstein/\">rod rosenstein</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/roger-stone/\">roger stone</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/russia-investigation/\">russia investigation</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/new-york-ny-usa-april-23-626628800\" target=\"_blank\">lev radin / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">16 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hancock, Laura.  “Wyoming’s Perennial Candidate, Al Hamburg, Dies.”<br>\n  <em>Casper Star Tribune</em>.  6 October 2014.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hamburg, Al.  “Hamburg v.

Some claim the YouTube video is only a teaser, and that somewhere a full-length version exists which — if and when it is made public — will finally expose Hillary Clinton for the murderous Satanic pedophile ringleader she truly is.

According Heidi Beirich of the hate group watchdog Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the KKK no longer exists as a national organization. While there are <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">small</a>, splinter groups around the country, they do not coordinate or cooperate:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>We haven’t had a unified Klan group since the period of the Civil Rights Movement. The United Klans of America was organized cross-country and was centralized terrorist organization, really. The Klan groups now are separate organizations who don’t like each other and don’t work with each other.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That wasn’t always the case, however. According to Beirich, who directs the SPLC’s Intelligence Project (which tracks extremism, anti-government hardliners and hate groups), the Klan had two resurgent eras after the Civil War in which its numbers and influence soared: in the 1920s (during the height of a national <a href=\"http://time.com/4411701/immigration-policy-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debate</a> about immigration) and during the Civil Rights era in the 1950s and 1960s. That ended in 1984, when the SPLC successfully <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/seeking-justice/case-docket/donald-v-united-klans-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sued</a> the last nationally-organized group, the United Klans of America, for lynching 19-year-old Michael Donald in Mobile, Alabama.</p>\n<p>The verdict against the group along with criminal convictions against the men responsible for the murder essentially put the group out of existence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The two Klansmen who carried out the ritualistic killing were eventually arrested and convicted. Convinced that the Klan itself should be held responsible for the lynching, Center attorneys filed a civil suit on behalf of Donald’s mother, Beulah Mae Donald vs. United Klans. In 1987, the Center won an historic $7 million verdict against the men involved in the lynching.</p>\n<p>The verdict marked the end of the United Klans, the same group that had beaten the Freedom Riders in 1961, murdered civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo in 1965, and bombed Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The SPLC maintains a list of 82 hate groups with agendas that include white nationalism, anti-Muslim, anti-gay, and anti-immigration that either currently have tax-exempt status or had that status revoked. They include the National Policy Institute, a group run by white supremacist Richard Spencer that <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-richard-spencer-taxes-20170223-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lost</a> its tax-exempt status in 2017 because Spencer failed to file necessary paperwork to maintain it.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.guidestar.org/profile/26-1654936\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">located</a> a nonprofit organization called the National Ku Klux Klan Museum in Maryland, but it doesn’t appear to be active, and its purpose is unclear.

It actually shows a scene from the closing credits of the 2001 movie <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Troopers</a>.</em> It’s revealed early in the movie that the character of Farva was suspended for an incident on a school bus with unruly children. The incident is not addressed in great detail during the film, but this “dashcam footage” was shown during the closing credits to give viewers a glimpse at the infamous incident.</p>\n<p>The “Crazy Credits” section for the movie’s listing on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/crazycredits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IMBD</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The credits are accompanied by: 1) various identifying shots of the actors; 2) scenes involving the stoners and a busted party; and 3) Farva’s oft-joked-about “bus incident”. Finally, all the way at the end of the credits, there is a little “gag” reel clip, concerning Farva’s excessive drinking at the governor’s party.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fans of <em>Super Troopers </em>may have been easily able to tell that this was a joke, but not everyone on the internet is as well versed in pop culture references.

Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.</p>\n<p>Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.</p>\n<p>She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle

It appears that she actually received and <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18361\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forwarded</a> an <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attachment</a> from <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/author/james-p-rubin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">James P.

Rubin<br>\nSent: Monday, April 30, 2012 11:03 AM<br>\nTo: H</p>\n<p>Subject: Best of luck on China trip</p>\n<p>First, I want to wish you and Kurt best of luck getting out of the pickle Mr Chen has you in as you arrive in China. I wanted to pass on something I intend to publish on Syria and Iran, because I think it is worth trying to urge the President and his political advisers to act. As you can see from today’s column by Jackson Diehl, the pundits and many in the media will push the Syria issue very hard for the foreseeable future. It may not be on the front burner every day, but it will be close to or at the top of the media’s attention indefinitely. Interestingly, the Republicans have showed their hand on the foreign policy debate, in which inaction on Syria is pretty much the only serious criticism they can offer that will stick. As you will see from the attached piece, I believe that action on Syria will forestall the biggest danger on the horizon, that Israel launches a surprise attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Although the pressure has now eased for a variety of reasons, it will return. Action by Washington on Syria, on the other hand, I believe will eliminate much of the urgency for Israeli action. In other words, a more aggressive policy on Syria will eliminate the best case the republican’s have going into the November election, will ease substantially the pressure on Israel to attack Iran and possibly spark a wider war in the Middle East, and finally would be the right stance on Syria going forward. I know you may not agree but I thought it was better to share this with you first as at least a new way to look at the problem.</p>\n<p>All best, your friend,<br>\nJamie</p>\n<p>James P.

Bluehole Studio has not, however, filed a lawsuit over Fortnite: Battle Royale. </p>\n<p>The hoax also coincided with a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43742970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">server issue</a> that temporarily took Fortnite: Battle Royale offline.  In other words, it was the perfect time to post a fake message from the company about the game’s termination. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/battle-royale/\">battle royale</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fortnite/\">fortnite</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fortnite-battle-royale/\">fortnite battle royale</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/games/\">games</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/lawsuits/\">lawsuits</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/pubg/\">pubg</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bagogames/39943037982\" target=\"_blank\">BagoGames / FLICKR</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sholtz, Matthew.   “PUBG Creator Bluehole has Filed Suit Against NetEase for Copyright and Trademark Violations.”<br>\n    <em>Android Police</em>.   9 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>BBC</em>.   “Battle Royale: Fortnite Hit by Server Outage.”<br>\n    12 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "208"},

Dahmer struck the young man in the head with a barbell and buried his body behind his house in Bath Township.</p>\n<p>With the weight of the murder on his shoulders, Dahmer walked onto the OSU campus for autumn quarter classes a mere three months later. Little is known about his tenure as a Buckeye.</p>\n<p>Dahmer resided in Morrill Tower for only one quarter and never officially declared a major.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Dahmer was not officially listed as a member of any university organizations or athletics, and his tenure at OSU was cut short when he failed to enroll in winter quarter classes for the 1979 term.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have so far been unable to track down Scott Burgeson for comment.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fake-photograph/\">fake photograph</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/ice-bong/\">ice bong</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/jeffrey-dahmer/\">jeffrey dahmer</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/snow-bong/\">snow bong</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Romagnino, Kara.   “Killers Part of OSU’s Past.”<br>\n    <em>The Lantern</em>.   30 October 2005.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "89"},

What I said was — Dana White confirmed on camera, to a reporter, that he has an offer for Floyd to fight in the UFC, he also indicated that it was a very large offer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Al Raisi also said, “Some members of the media took my words a bit wrong,” citing an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SiriusXMBoxing/status/983510418688757761\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview</a> he gave to SiriusXM radio hosts Gerry Cooney and Randy Gordon in which he said, “Number one I’m not claiming that the fight is confirmed, absolutely not.” He added, “Both parties have not agreed.

It went back and forth.”</p>\n<p>When asked to identify when White confirmed the offer to Mayweather Al Raisi told us, “He said it in one of the interviews I watched, I can’t remember for which media outlet it was for.”</p>\n<p>White did <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/21826203/ufc-floyd-mayweather-jr-discussing-mixed-martial-arts-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tell</a> ESPN in December 2017, “We’re interested in doing something with Floyd.” In April 2018, he <a href=\"http://mmajunkie.com/2018/04/dana-white-floyd-mayweather-ufc-fight-conor-mcgregor-mma-boxing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> of the prospect of Mayweather fighting in a UFC event, “Yeah, I could see this happening,” but that it would go “very badly” for him. Al Raisi said of White’s statement refuting his initial post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Well, he is supposed to say that, he said something similar when the news started to come out on Mayweather vs McGregor’s boxing fight. Remember? Dana White is a very intelligent business man, and he knows what to do. He has built this sport of MMA and hopefully we will see him come over to Boxing and do the same.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rumors of a rematch between Mayweather and McGregor have swirled since their first encounter, which was held under boxing rules on 26 August 2017. Mayweather <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/41064767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">won</a> that fight after scoring a technical knockout against McGregor in the tenth round, bringing his record to 50-0.</p>\n<p>More recently, White publicly criticized McGregor for what he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/04/06/conor-mcgregor-arrested-after-rampage-at-ufc-event/?utm_term=.8cc03778f28d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> a “coordinated attack” during a UFC press conference in Brooklyn, New York on 6 April 2018 — two days before Al Rani’s first post about the alleged negotiations. McGregor was arrested and charged with one count of criminal mischief and three counts of misdemeanor assault for allegedly throwing objects at a bus, causing injuries to two fighters sitting inside and causing their respective contests to be canceled.</p>\n<p>“This was a real bad career move for him. Right now? No. I mean, do you want to be in business with Conor McGregor right now?” White said. “Do you want to chase this guy around for interviews and buy his fights. Do you?”</p>\n<p>McGregor was released after posting $50,000 bail. He is due back in court on 14 June 2018.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Update [13 April 2018]: Correction - noted that the Sports Journal is based in the United Arab Emirates.</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/boxing/\">boxing</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/conor-mcgregor/\">conor mcgregor</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/dana-white/\">Dana White</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/floyd-mayweather-jr/\">Floyd Mayweather Jr.</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/ufc/\">ufc</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mazique, Brian. “Floyd Mayweather Vs.

Jerry Brown for a forced exodus of sex offenders from his state’s penal system.</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>According to the story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over 10,000 sex offenders including convicted pedophiles and rapists are set to be released to the streets in the near future thanks to Governor Jerry Brown and the ruling of a Superior Court Judge in Sacramento who say crimes such as “intimately touching an unlawfully restrained person” or “raping a drugged or unconscious victim” are not violent crimes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The story was based on a <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11649307\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruling</a> by Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Allen Sumner on 8 February 2018 concerning the implications of Proposition 57, which was passed in a November 2016 vote.</p>\n<p>The measure — which Brown supported — went into effect on 1 July 2017, and allowed the bill, which went into effect on 1 July 2017, allowed for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to set parole consideration standards for certain non-violent offenders. However, inmates who were required to register as sex offenders, according to <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-1/290-294/290/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">section 290</a> of the California Penal Code, are barred from being part of this process.</p>\n<p>Sumner issued a preliminary order to CDCR requiring the agency to implement a more stringent definition for “nonviolent offenders.” His decision hinged in part on a discrepancy between section 290 and section 667.5 of the same penal code, which covers non-violent offenses. He <a href=\"http://all4consolaws.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CA-Proposition-57-tentative-Ruling-8-Feb-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>The [state] Legislature has listed rape of a drugged, intoxicated or unconscious victim, sex trafficking of a minor, and lewd acts with a child who is 14 or 15 as registrable sex offenses under section 290. But the Legislature has not listed these as “violent” felonies in section 667.5. It thus appears the opponents assumed the term “nonviolent” in Proposition 57 was defined by reference to the “violent” felonies listed in section 667.5. If so, it would not apply to registerable sex offenses not listed in section 667.5.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sumner also found that CDCR applied an “overbroad” standard because under its guidelines, prior registration as a sex offender would disqualify an inmate seeking a parole review for a conviction stemming from a non-violent offense such as tax evasion.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit challenging the measure was filed by Alliance for Constitutional Sex Offense Laws. The group’s president, attorney Janice Bellucci, has said that Sumner’s ruling could lead to 10,000 inmates becoming eligible to go through the process to gain an early parole.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the blog’s story, a CDCR spokesperson told us that it does not anticipate any sex offenders being “released to the streets” any time soon. The agency spokesperson told us that it plans to appeal the decision:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the meantime, none of these offenders (as defined by PC 290, or sex offenders) will be released or even be considered for the nonviolent parole process under Proposition 57, and the regulations for Proposition 57 stand as they have been drafted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a CDCR <a href=\"https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/proposition57/docs/FAQ-Prop-57-General-Questions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">release,</a> 1,877 inmates were released in October 2017 after amassing credits for good conduct that were applied toward an early release date.</p>\n<p>Brown continued to support Prop 57 in a <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/sd-jerry-brown-proposition-57-fear-mongering-utak-20180213-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a> to the <em>San Diego Union-Tribune</em>, accusing the newspaper’s editorial board of engaging in “shameless fear-mongering” following Sumner’s ruling.</p>\n<p>“Proposition 57 vests broad discretion in the secretary of corrections and the Parole Board to protect our community and fashion a rational system of punishment and rehabilitation,” Brown wrote. “This is a job for dedicated and experienced professionals, not cynical politicians. Yes, we can make our system better, and we will.”</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/california/\">california</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/jerry-brown/\">jerry brown</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/pedophilia/\">pedophilia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/prison/\">prison</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/rapists/\">rapists</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/your-news-wire/\">your news wire</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/46671804@N08/4588142782/\" target=\"_blank\">Sacramento Press [CC BY-NC-SA 2.0] / Flickr</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</em> “Proposition 57: The Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016 Frequently Asked Questions.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thompson, Dan. “Judge: California Must Consider Early Parole for Sex Offenders.”<br>\n<em>    Associated Press,</em> accessed via kqed.org. 10 February 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>San Diego Union-Tribune.</em> “Gov.

People are hoping that by bringing awareness to this that somehow we can get sodium fluoride removed from the world’s water supply.</p>\n<p>A big step has been made here recently. In the most prestigious medical journal […] known as The Lancet [,] fluoride has been at last classified as a neurotoxin one hundred percent. This puts it in the same category as things like lead, arsenic, and mercury. This news was released by the author Stefan Smyle who actually cited a report that had been published in The Lancet Neurology, Volume 13, Issue 3 […] in the March of 2014 edition.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Right off the bat, there are a number of elements that should jump out at the reader as dubious. First, studies — even ones published in prestigious journals — do not themselves “declare” or “classify” anything as a neurotoxin; governmental organizations, using published research and other data, make determinations about a chemical’s danger and regulate it accordingly.</p>\n<p>In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of chemicals approved as <i>non-</i>toxic under the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/tsca-inventory/about-tsca-chemical-substance-inventory#whatistheinventory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toxic Substances Control Act</a>, and they regulate standards for levels of human-made and natural contaminants in water under the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/background-drinking-water-standards-safe-drinking-water-act-sdwa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Safe Drinking Water Act</a>. For food or cosmetic products, the Food and Drug Administration makes similar determinations under the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194909.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a>.</p>\n<p>Second, the concept of classifying something as “one hundred percent” neurotoxic betrays the original author’s ignorance of the concept of toxicity. Toxicologists do not refer to toxicity in any way that could be represented as a percentage, instead they develop exposure guidelines and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/dwregdev/how-epa-regulates-drinking-water-contaminants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reference doses</a>. The dose, as they say, makes the poison, and many things that are legally allowed to be in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153292/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food</a> are, in fact, neurotoxic at high enough doses.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the viral claim can be debunked as false without even getting into the <i>Lancet Neurology</i> paper cited in these stories. However, since that paper continues to be attached to these viral click traps, it is worth noting that the study itself included no new analyses about the neurotoxicity of fluoride.</p>\n<p><b>The <em>Lancet Neurology</em> Paper</b></p>\n<p>Though presented as a large-scale study revealing new toxicologic information about fluoride, this <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4418502&amp;blobtype=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paper</a> (which was in <i>Lancet Neurology, </i>not <i>The Lancet</i>) introduced no new data on fluoride neurotoxicity. It instead makes a broader argument that all chemicals should be considered<i> </i>neurotoxic to children given science’s inability to accurately or effectively assess neurotoxicity to developing brains, citing past research on fluoride as one example of a potentially harmful chemical:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The paper itself drew fierce criticism from scientists in both <a href=\"https://blog.americanchemistry.com/2014/02/authors-ignore-fundamental-principles-of-science-in-lancet-paper-opt-for-alarmism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">industry</a> and academia when it was first published, and <i>Lancet Neurology </i>ended up publishing an unusually large of number of professional <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">responses</a> to the study. Authored by Harvard School of Public Health professor Philippe Grandjean and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Professor Philip J. Landrigan, this 2014 paper is a follow up an earlier paper written by the same authors that incorporates new studies that had been conducted since then.</p>\n<p>The entirety of new information about fluoride in the 2014 iteration of their work boils down to a single new study — a meta-review of 27 smaller scale studies published in a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2012 paper</a> which also included Grandjean as an author. It also drew significant academic backlash and media attention. The paper was so misrepresented by some media accounts hailing it as rock-solid evidence that water fluoridation reduces the intelligence of children that the authors actually had to append a <a href=\"https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2012/07/Media-Statement_Fluoride-9-12-12-Revised2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clarification notice</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release</a> sent out by Harvard, stating their results could not be used to assess the levels at which fluoride could become neurotoxic:</p>\n<blockquote><p>These results do not allow us to make any judgment regarding possible levels of risk at levels of exposure typical for water fluoridation in the U.S. On the other hand, neither can it be concluded that no risk is present. We therefore recommend further research to clarify what role fluoride exposure levels may play in possible adverse effects on brain development, so that future risk assessments can properly take into regard this possible hazard.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The reason that this study can not be used to draw a direct comparison the United States or to water fluoridation programs in general is because<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/table/t1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> most of the studies</a> are from China and utilize the natural variations of fluoride in groundwater, which is found in high concentration in some regions there. In many cases, the studies analyzed in the 2012 review investigate extremely high concentrations of fluoride that far exceed legal limits in the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fluoride Argument</strong></p>\n<p>Further — and despite assurances by Grandjean and Landrigan to the contrary — many of the studies included in the 2012 review (which were translated from Chinese and republished in the journal <i>Fluoride</i> years after their original publication) do not provide  anywhere near enough information to defend the claim that their documented associations between exposure to fluoride and reduced IQ are “unlikely” to be driven by another chemical in drinking water (such as arsenic) that could also have a neurologic effect. For a more detailed look at the criticisms of that 2012 study, please see <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/water-fluoridation-reduces-iq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our post</a> on claims that water fluoridation can reduce a person’s intelligence quotient.</p>\n<p>A better study to reference if one were interested in providing an argument that fluoride could have cognitive effects on developing brains would be a <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/ehp655/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2017 paper</a> published in<i> Environmental Health Perspectives</i>, which demonstrates an association between prenatal fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in mother-offspring pairs in Mexico. This study, like many in the review described above, is not great for comparisons to United States water fluoridation, however. That’s because the  mother-offspring pairs in this 2017 study were exposed either to naturally occurring fluoride or through fluoride added <a href=\"http://www.who.int/oral_health/publications/orh_IDJ_salt_fluoration.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">to salt</a>, not to water. It therefore <span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">cannot be used confidently to assess the levels at which fluoride in drinking water could be neurotoxic to developing brains:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Our findings, combined with evidence from existing animal and human studies, reinforce the need for additional research on potential adverse effects of fluoride, particularly in pregnant women and children, and to ensure that the benefits of population-level fluoride supplementation outweigh any potential risks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These preliminary findings aside, the 2014 study referenced in viral posts did not “officially declare” anything about fluoride, as it and the authors that created it have no authority to do so. It instead made a controversial argument for a more proactive approach to chemical regulation using old and potentially flawed data about fluoride. For all these reasons, we rank the claim that a new paper in <i>The Lancet</i> has ruled that fluoride is a neurotoxin as false.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote

No shooter ever arrived. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/hfiR1kE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-137576\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/hfiR1kE.jpg?resize=600,600\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/hfiR1kE.jpg?w=640 640w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/hfiR1kE.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/hfiR1kE.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a> </p>\n<p>This narrative first emerged online in May 2016, when a Reddit user <a href=\"http://archive.is/1j1H9\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> the photograph to the “Old School Cool” subreddit with the following description:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A student and teacher guarding the high school in my hometown in 1973. There was a shooting threat called in the morning. Students and teachers alike pulled their shotguns from their trunks to guard the doors between classes. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This description is not entirely accurate, though it does contain some elements of the truth. The photograph was indeed taken outside a high school in Delaware in 1973 — Caesar Rodney High School in Camden, to be precise. The two young men are both students, contrary to the claim that one was a teacher. Kendall Cool (on the left) and Carl Willoughby (on the right) were both seniors at the time. </p>\n<p>As a result of <a href=\"http://archive.is/7CFzJ\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> and <a href=\"http://archive.is/wVQZu\" target=\"_blank\">inquiries</a> made by Caleb Smith, who runs the “School Violence Exposed” web site, other Caesar Rodney alumni explained the background to the photograph in a Facebook group:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[In the] Spring [of] ’73 we had a series of bomb scares at the time and Kendall and Carl brought their hunting rifles to the door for a photo op. I believe it was exam week and seemed like everyone knew when the bomb scares were coming in, totally upset the exam schedule…</p></blockquote>\n<p>The photograph made it into the school’s 1973 <a href=\"http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/davidmobrien/media/bWVkaWFJZDo3NjU5NzA5/?ref=1\" target=\"_blank\">yearbook</a>, which also features headshots of <a href=\"http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/davidmobrien/media/bWVkaWFJZDo3NjU5NzEw/?ref=1\" target=\"_blank\">Cool</a> and <a href=\"http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/davidmobrien/media/bWVkaWFJZDo3NjYwNDI3/?ref=1\" target=\"_blank\">Willoughby</a>. </p>\n<p>There was a series of bomb threats made to Caesar Rodney High School during that academic year, but they appear to have been made in the fall rather than the spring (although it is possible there was a second spate of scares later in the year.) According to an <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/163768464\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> in the Wilmington <em>News Journal</em>, there were “three or more bomb threats each day” over a three-day period during the first week of November 1972. “Each call resulted in an evacuation of the school’s 1,600 students.”</p>\n<p>About a week later, police arrested three Caesar Rodney students — all juveniles — and charged them with making false bomb threats, the <em>News Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/164437922\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>. We did not find any evidence that anyone had threatened to perpetrate a shooting (as opposed to a bombing) at Caesar Rodney at any point during the 1972-73 academic year. </p>\n<p>This is indeed a photograph of two armed young men keeping watch outside a Delaware high school in 1973. However, beyond that, the “good guys with guns” narrative of the 2016 and 2018 meme begins to crumble. There was a series of bomb threats at the school that year, but they were hoaxes, and appear to have been no more than a teenage prank. Most importantly, there was no shooting threat, something that fatally undermines the rhetorical thrust of the meme. “No shooter ever arrived,” as the meme dramatically concludes, because no shooter ever threatened to arrive.</p>\n<p>As intimidating as Cool and Willoughby may have been, there is absolutely no evidence that their armed watch is the one thing that kept their friends and classmates safe. </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/delaware/\">delaware</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-control/\">gun control</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-rights/\">gun rights</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-violence/\">gun violence</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/history/\">history</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Smith, Caleb.  “Delaware High School 1973: What Actually Happened!”<br>\n  <em>School Violence Exposed</em>.  10 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The News Journal.  “$100 Reward Offered in Bomb Scares.”<br>\n  <em>The News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware.)</em>  9 November 1972</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The News Journal.  “Dover Bomb Calls Traced to 3 Pupils.”<br>\n  <em>The News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware.)</em>  16 November 1972</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "163"},

And they did just that.”</p>\n<p>Ross, who is black, referenced his own experiences while making his case, saying, “As an African-American male, I am very aware of implicit bias.”</p>\n<p>“We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe data-src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphillypolice%2Fvideos%2F10155712644170910%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></p><noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphillypolice%2Fvideos%2F10155712644170910%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></noscript>\n<p>Starbucks extended an apology to the “two individuals and our customers for what took place,” promising to review their policies so that “these types of situations never happen” again:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We apologize to the two individuals and our customers for what took place at our Philadelphia store on Thursday. <a href=\"https://t.co/suUsytXHks\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/suUsytXHks</a></p>\n<p>— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Starbucks/status/985200942030012416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 14, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>14 April 2018 [1:36 P.M.]: Added second video; changed truth rating from \"Unproven\" to \"True.\" -bb</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/\" class=\"author-link\">David Mikkelson</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook video / Melissa DePino</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">14 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">15 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Longo, Brandon.   “‘Internal Investigation’ Underway Following Arrest at Philly Starbucks.”<br>\n    <em>CBS Philly</em>.   14 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Horton, Alex.   “Two Black Men Were Arrested Waiting at a Starbucks.

Some drew a comparison to the experiences of Japanese Americans during World War II, when, despite peacetime laws prohibiting it, data collected by the Census Bureau on race and national origin was used by the Secret Service to target people of Japanese ancestry for internment.</p>\n<p>In February 1942, two months after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, triggering the United States’ entry into World War II, President Roosevelt signed <a href=\"https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&amp;doc=74&amp;page=transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Executive Order 9066</a>, which authorized the Secretary of War to designate certain regions as “military areas” from which anyone deemed a risk to national security could be excluded for the duration of the war. As a result of the order, approximately 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry (two-thirds of whom were native-born U.S. citizens) were required to report to “assembly centers” along the West Coast, then <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/japanese-relocation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relocated</a> to internment camps further inland. They weren’t released until the war ended in 1945.</p>\n<p>Although long rumored, allegations that the Census Bureau played a role in these relocations were regarded for the most part with skepticism (and denied by the bureau itself) due to a lack of evidence. That changed in 2000, however, when a pair of academic researchers, William Seltzer and Margo Anderson, <a href=\"http://ww2.amstat.org/about/statisticiansinhistory/index.cfm?fuseaction=paperinfo&amp;PaperID=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uncovered</a> proof of the Census Bureau’s complicity.</p>\n<p>They found that in addition to releasing “macrodata” from the 1940 census detailing the distribution of Japanese populations by state, county, and city (information that wouldn’t necessarily have violated the agency’s confidentiality requirements), the Census Bureau complied with requests to share finer-grained “mesodata” (gathered, in some instances, at the city block level) with the Western Defense Command, which was in charge of carrying out the forced relocations.</p>\n<p>Although Seltzer and Anderson’s 2000 report fell short of confirming that the worst sort of privacy violations occurred (sharing confidential information about individuals), it elicited an admission and apology from the Census Bureau’s then-director, Kenneth Prewitt, who wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The historical record is clear that senior Census Bureau staff proactively cooperated with the internment, and that census tabulations were directly implicated in the denial of civil rights to citizens of the United States who happened also to be of Japanese ancestry.</p>\n<p>The record is less clear whether the then in effect legal prohibitions against revealing individual data records were violated. On this question, the judicial principle of innocent until proven otherwise should be honored. However, even were it to be conclusively documented that no such violation did occur, this would not and could not excuse the abuse of human rights that resulted from the rapid provision of tabulations designed to identify where Japanese Americans lived and therefore to facilitate and accelerate the forced relocation and denial of civil rights.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a 2007 follow-up paper, Seltzer and Anderson <a href=\"https://news.fordham.edu/inside-fordham-category/study-finds-census-gave-names-of-japanese-americans-to-security-agencies-during-world-war-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demonstrated</a> that the Census Bureau had indeed turned over “microdata” consisting of the names and addresses of individual Japanese Americans residing in Washington, DC to the Secret Service. The <em>Washington Post</em> reported:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While the Census Bureau had no such record, the pair found the information in records kept by the chief clerk of the Commerce Department. Under the Second War Powers Act, which suspended the confidentiality protections for census data, the chief clerk had the authority to release census data to other agencies. That meant while the information released was not illegal, it was ethically questionable, the researchers said.</p>\n<p>The August 4, 1943, request was made by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau. He had asked for the names and addresses of all individuals of Japanese ancestry living in Washington. Morgenthau had requested the information to aid in a Secret Service investigation of threats made against President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>In all, information about 79 people in Washington was released, the researchers found. The records did not indicate that personal information was released on Japanese Americans living in other parts of the United States.</p>\n<p>The request was filled within seven days — remarkably quick for a government bureaucracy, researchers said at the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although this level of data sharing had been made legal under the emergency provisions of the Second War Powers Act of 1942, it would nevertheless have been illegal in peacetime and took place in direct contravention of the public promises made on the 1940 census form:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only sworn census employees will see your statements. Data collected will be used solely for preparing statistical information concerning the Nation’s population, resources, and business activities. Your Census Reports Cannot Be Used for Purposes of Taxation, Regulation, or Investigation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Normal privacy protections were restored when the Second War Powers Act was repealed in 1947, and additional restrictions, including a “<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/www/genealogy/decennial_census_records/the_72_year_rule_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">72-Year Rule</a>” barring the release of “personally identifiable information about an individual to any other individual or agency until 72 years after it was collected for the decennial census,” were subsequently enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p>However, history has demonstrated that under circumstances deemed extraordinary and urgent enough to reverse such protections, they can be undone at the drop of a hat — a fact unlikely to be forgotten by groups asked to reveal sensitive information about themselves in future censuses.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/census/\">census</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/japanese-internment/\">japanese internment</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/secret-service/\">secret service</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/world-war-ii/\">world war ii</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASan_Francisco%2C_California._On_a_brick_wall_beside_air_raid_shelter_poster%2C_exclusion_orders_were_po_._._._-_NARA_-_536018.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Dorothea Lange [Public domain] /  Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Aratani, Lori.  “Secret Use of Census Info Helped Send Japanese Americans to Internment Camps in WWII.”<br>\n  <em>The Washington Post</em>.  6 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Holmes, Steven A.  “Report Says Census Bureau Helped Relocate Japanese.”<br>\n  <em>The New York Times</em>.  17 March 2000.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mayer, Thomas S.  “Privacy and Confidentiality Research and the U.S. Census Bureau.”<br>\n  <em>U.S. Census Bureau</em>.  2002.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Seltzer, William and Anderson, Margo.  “After Pearl Harbor: The Proper Role of Population Data Systems in Time of War.”<br>\n  <em>American Statistical Association</em>.  8 March 2000.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Watanabe, Teresa.  “In 1943, Census Released Japanese Americans’ Data.”<br>\n  <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.  31 March 2007.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Fordham University</em>.  “Study Finds Census Gave Names of Japanese Americans to Security Agencies During World War II.”<br>\n  4 May 2007.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>National Archives</em>.  “Japanese Relocation During World War II.”<br>\n  10 April 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>U.S. Census Bureau</em>.  “Census Confidentiality and Privacy: 1790 – 2002.”<br>\n  2003.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "1K"},

Rather, it can be dated back to an unsourced 2006 article posted to a web site called <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20061018100759/http://www.instapunk.com/archives/InstaPunkArchiveV2.php3?a=872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InstaPunk</a>. </p>\n<p>The<em> </em>article was published shortly after the release of director Oliver Stone’s 2006 movie <em>World Trade Center.</em> The article seemingly poked fun at New Yorkers who felt that it was “too soon” to release a film about the 9/11 terrorist attack, which claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people and used a fictional interview with a nonexistent Anna Mae Dickinson published in a nonexistent newspaper to underscore its point:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As Oliver Stone’s World Trade Center rolls out into theaters across the country, New Yorkers are clearly struggling with their emotions about the picture and its all-too-real premise.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>As sad as all this is, it pales in comparison to the trauma experienced by Anna Mae Dickinson, resident of Lower Manhattan and, at 102, the oldest and last surviving victim of the 1912 sinking of the Titanic. Her story is told in a moving piece in the New York Intelligencer:</p>\n<p><em>She was eight when she lost her father and narrowly escaped death herself on the Titanic. She was 11 when she lost her Aunt Olivia in the torpedoing of the Lusitania. She was 31 when she lost her first cousin Alfred in the Hindenberg explosion. She was 37 when she lost her nephew Thomas in the bombing of Pearl Harbor. And she was 97 when her tiny apartment was shaken and battered by the collapse of the twin towers on September 11, 2001.</em></p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Then, finally, the bitterly hard question of the day: How does she feel about them making a movie of that devastating day?</p>\n<p><em>This time, Anna Mae answers loud and clear, with no need for assistance from her nurse: “Too soon,” she cries. “Too soon. The wounds are all still too fresh. They had no right to make that disgusting movie about our poor ship when some of us were still alive to feel the pain.” And then she commences to sob like an eight-year-old girl.</em></p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>So if New Yorkers think they’re exquisitely sensitive, maybe they should take a minute to think about the titanic example set by Anna Mae. For many of the 9/11 survivors, it will be a long, hard, distracting road to the age of 102, and the truth is, too many of them aren’t dwelling nearly enough in the past to make their grief last so long and so monotholically.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article contained details that offered clues that the story was intended as satire. For instance, it reported that all of the clocks in Dickinson’s home were permanently frozen at 2:20, the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/titanic-sinks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time</a> that the Titanic sank into the ocean. It also claimed that the interview with Anna Mae Dickinson was originally published in a publication called the<em> New York Intelligencer,</em> but we found no record of a publication by that name. A column called “The Daily Intelligencer” is published in <em>New York </em>magazine, but we found no mention of Mrs. Dickinson in their pages. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, a <a href=\"http://www.titanicfacts.net/titanic-passenger-list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list</a> of <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic_passenger_list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passengers</a> aboard the Titanic does not include anyone <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/289726567/?terms=titanic+passenger+list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">named</a> Anna Mae Dickinson.</p>\n<p>The final nail in this claim’s coffin, however, comes from a simple reverse image search of the included photograph. The woman in this picture is not Titanic/Hindenburg/Lusitania/Pearl Harbor/September 11th terrorist attack survivor Anna Mae Dickinson. This is actually a photograph of American folk artist Anna Mary Robertson Moses (better known as <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/515024140\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grandma Moses</a>).</p>\n<p>The story about the Anna Mae Dickinson, or “luckiest woman to ever live,” was invented for a 2006 article chiding New Yorkers who felt that it was “too soon” to make a movie about the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. This article, which featured a fictional interview in a non-existent publication, was later boiled down into a meme which used an image of non-Titanic survivor Grandma Moses. </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/11-september/\">11 september</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/grandma-moses/\">grandma moses</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/hindenburg/\">hindenburg</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+5 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/instapunk/\">instapunk</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/luckiest-woman/\">luckiest woman</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/lusitania/\">lusitania</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/peal-harbor/\">peal harbor</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/titanic/\">titanic</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/belfast-ni-july-14-2016-documental-467321948\" target=\"_blank\">Anton_Ivanov / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>History.com</em>.   “This Day in History: The Titanic Sinks.”<br>\n    Retrieved 12 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Instapunk</em>.   “The Oldest Victim.”<br>\n    5 August 2006.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Salt Lake Telegram</em>.   “Titanic Passenger Lists, First and Second Class.”<br>\n    16 April 1912.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "152"},

href=\"https://archive.li/Pd5nk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that 28-year-old Ekaterina Fedyaeva had been “embalmed alive”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ekaterina Fedyaeva’s mother has accused medics of ‘murder’ after they put her daughter on a formalin drip – a solution contain formaldehyde – instead of saline.</p>\n<p>She was given a drip normally infused into the veins of the dead to prevent decomposition.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other news <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/09/her-surgery-was-supposed-to-be-routine-instead-this-russian-woman-was-embalmed-alive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> were light on details about the medical mishap, stating only that Fedyaeva had been given “formalin, a solution that contains formaldehyde — which is used to preserve dead bodies.”</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/5099286\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> from the Russian news agency TACC (translated) clarified the chain of events, reporting that formalin had mistakenly been used instead of saline during a relatively routine removal of ovarian cysts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On March 15 [2018], medical personnel mistakenly introduced formalin instead of saline into the abdominal cavity of a 28-year-old female patient during a routine operation.</p>\n<p>After detecting what happened, doctors performed a [cleaning] of the abdominal cavity to remove the substance from the body. The next day, the woman was transferred to the Ulyanovsk Regional Clinical Hospital, then for the most effective course of treatment the patient was sent to the FGBU of the State Scientific Center of the All-Russian Medical Center named after A.I. Burnazyan FMBA of Russia. As previously reported, investigators of the regional SS of the Criminal Code initiated a criminal case of causing serious harm to human health through negligence as a result of improper performance by a person of their professional duties (Article 118 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The routine surgery <a href=\"https://russian.rt.com/russia/article/500835-smert-vrachi-formalin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">took place</a> on 15 March 2018. Early local reports contradicted the repeated claim that Fedyaeva was placed on a “formalin drip,” stating that an “unknown nurse” <a href=\"http://73online.ru/r/strashnaya_tragediya_v_msch_zhenshine_posle_operacii_vlili_formalin_vmesto_fizrastvora-57857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">washed</a> the surgical site with formalin instead of saline. Four days later, Fedyaeva was <a href=\"http://73online.ru/r/mama_otravlennoy_formalinom_kati_fedyaevoy_eto_ne_oshibka_a_prestuplenie-58019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transported</a> to Moscow where doctors worked to undo the damage caused by the administered formalin, but the patient <a href=\"http://73online.ru/r/ekaterina_fedyaeva_umerla_-58342\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">succumbed</a> to her injuries on 5 April 2018.</p>\n<p>Ongoing accounts published by local news sources provide a relatively clear timeline. No formalin drip was substituted for saline, nor was the patient <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/story/37918477/woman-embalmed-alive-after-tragic-hospital-mix-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">injected</a> with formalin. Initial English-language reports claimed Fedyaeva had been “given a drip normally infused into the veins of the dead to prevent decomposition,” suggesting that the medical mishap amounted to an accidental embalming, but according to morticians that was not even close to the case.</p>\n<p>In an assessment of the claims, mortician <a href=\"https://www.calebwilde.com/2018/04/my-thoughts-on-that-russian-woman-who-was-embalmed-alive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caleb Wilde</a> wrote that a “slow, intravenous drip of formalin would have ripped apart the insides of Ekaterina Fedyaeva.” Wilde repeated his skepticism that the story occurred in the manner reported, adding that “formalin has a potent smell … that burns when you breathe it in … whoever put formalin in the IV bag (and I don’t know the protocols for filling IV bags) were either without a sense of smell, extremely dense, or they did it on purpose”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This per the often unreliable tabloid The Sun, “Ekaterina Fedyaeva was said to be undergoing routine surgery at a hospital in Ulyanovsk, in the Volga Federal District of Russia, when the hospital provided her on a formalin drip, which contains formaldehyde and is used to prevent corpses from decomposing.”</p>\n<p>I’m still hoping that this is some elaborate hoax. But it doesn’t seem to be. This is a once in a billion kind of mistake that could have only been made through a confluence of poorly designed and poorly practiced medical protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Pure formalin is a much strong[er] solution that the embalming fluid we use on dead bodies.</strong></p>\n<p>Formaldehyde is a naturally occurring gas that is highly dissolvable in water. When it is dissolved in water, it’s called “formalin”, which is the liquid that was intravenously given to Ekaterina. Formalin is 40% formaldehyde.</p>\n<p>Embalming fluid is rated by formaldehyde index: strong embalming fluid has an index of 28% to 36%, medium fluid has an index of 19% to 27%, and weak fluid is 10% to 18% index. Even our strongest embalming fluid has less formaldehyde than pure formalin, and even much less when we mix the embalming fluid with water.</p>\n<p>After we mix the embalming fluid with water, the solution has a much lower amount of formaldehyde, often around 2%. In other words, what was injected into Ekaterina — if it was formalin with 40% formaldehyde — could have been up to 20 times stronger than the embalming fluid I would use in my prep room.</p>\n<p>With arterial fluid that is 2%, I can effectively harden and preserve most cases. This is how it happens: “Formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde fixes tissue or cells by irreversibly connecting a primary amine group in a protein molecule with a nearby nitrogen in a protein or DNA molecule through a -CH2- linkage called a Schiff base” … To put it simply: formaldehyde literally rips apart tissue on a molecular level.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Formalin or formaldehyde is extremely <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MMG/MMG.asp?id=216&amp;tid=39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">toxic</a> and can easily be absorbed through the skin.</p>\n<p>Intravenous (or <a href=\"https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/drips-intravenous-fluids-or-iv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IV</a>) fluids are used to infuse medications or fluids into the bloodstream of a living person. This process is effective for the living because of the process of circulation. As Wilde notes, the procedures of embalming differ dramatically from those of IV administration.</p>\n<p>Although embalming fluid (which is around <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/business/despite-cancer-risk-embalmers-stay-with-formaldehyde.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">five percent</a> formaldehyde) is eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/embalmer-for-14-years-ask-me-anything\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">introduced</a> via a completely different apparatus, that process takes place only after the cadaver is drained of blood and fluids.</p>\n<p>Another question posed by many readers involved presence of formalin in the operating room. It is typically <a href=\"http://microscopy.arizona.edu/learn/formaldehyde-fixatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used</a> for routine <a href=\"http://www.histologyguide.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">histology</a>, and it was likely intended for the preservation and analysis of tissue collected during the operation. We contacted Wilde with additional questions about that subject, and he explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Formalin is not something that would be found in a funeral home’s prep room. There are two main types of embalming fluids that embalmers use: one is arterial fluid and the other is cavity fluid. Arterial fluid generally comes in a 16-ounce bottle that we generally dilute in water. Formalin is 40% formaldehyde. Bottled arterial fluid ranges from a weaker 10% to a stronger 38% of formaldehyde. When we’re ready to use the arterial fluid for embalming, we then dilute it in water which should result in a fluid that is somewhere between the range of 1.5% to 2% formaldehyde. This fluid is then pumped through the arterial system by means of an embalming machine. We make an incision in an artery, which is where the arterial fluid enters. And we make an incision in a vein, which is where the blood is forced out of the deceased’s body. The embalming fluid should displace the blood and dissipate throughout the entirety of the arterial system. There are some parts of the body that aren’t thoroughly reached by the arterial system, such as the abdominal and chest cavities. For those areas, we use a large syringe-like instrument called a trocar which is the tool we use to reach the cavities. That fluid is much stronger than the arterial fluid. The cavity fluid that we use at our funeral home is 20% formaldehyde. Unlike arterial fluid, we do not dilute cavity fluid with water.</p>\n<p>Although I do not use formalin, I understand that it is generally injected to preserve specimens in the same way we use a trocar, except with a smaller instrument like a syringe. Unlike arterial fluid, formalin is not injected through the arterial system but through a syringe-type instrument that is fanned throughout the entirety of the tissue. Formalin is so strong that if it were injected through the arterial system with an embalming machine, I would imagine that the strength of the fluid would make distribution difficult. It’s likely that formalin would in effect cauterize the capillaries and render the embalming incomplete, resulting in some of the tissue being unreached by the fluid and more susceptible to decomposition.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fedyaeva’s death remains under investigation, but initial reports indicated that a nurse mistakenly used formalin instead of saline to wash a surgical site. The patient was eventually transported to Moscow in efforts to reverse the damage, but she died a few days later. It appears that reports about inadvertent substitution of formalin for saline was correct, but the rest of the tragic medical mishap was misrepresented in many news accounts.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Updated 11 April 2018, 1:04 P.M.: Added additional information about the embalming process, and purpose of formalin.</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">10 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">11 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bever, Lindsey.   “Her Surgery Was Supposed To Be Routine.

On 30 December 1998, the <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/30/nyregion/new-requirement-for-sprinklers-in-apartment-buildings-is-likely.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Archie Spigner, the chairman of the City Council’s Housing and Buildings Committee, said yesterday that he received a telephone call this week from Donald J. Trump, the real estate developer, who expressed concern about the high cost of installation and other problems that he had with sprinklers. Mr. Trump confirmed yesterday that he had ”received and placed calls” from and to various city officials…</p>\n<p>…Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, said yesterday that most fatal fires occur in two- and three-family homes, not in high-rise buildings that have fire-resistant construction. He and Mr. Trump said that in addition to being costly — up to $4 per square foot to equip an entire building, Mr. Spinola said — sprinklers were also prone to vandalism and mishaps, and widely disliked by tenants for esthetic reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"192\" data-total-count=\"4424\">”We believe that the code that exists in New York City basically gives us the safest buildings,” Mr. Spinola said. ”We don’t believe sprinklers are necessary to have the safest buildings.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-para-count=\"192\" data-total-count=\"4424\">However, within a few months, reports appeared that Trump had adjusted his stance slightly and in March 1999, the New York City Council passed a compromise law that required “new residential buildings with four or more units” to have sprinklers in every apartment and hallway, and any renovation of an existing building which cost more than half the building’s value must also involve the installation of sprinklers. </p>\n<p data-para-count=\"192\" data-total-count=\"4424\">Older buildings like the Trump Tower do not fall under the scope of the regulations unless they undergo major renovations. The March 1999 law (<a href=\"http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=432422&amp;GUID=4529AA8C-FCCB-49BE-8619-B46AF50A2DD6\" target=\"_blank\">Local Law 10-1999</a>) also exempted buildings like the Trump World Tower, where excavation had already begun by that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/25/nyregion/giuliani-signs-bill-on-apartment-house-sprinklers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p data-para-count=\"192\" data-total-count=\"4424\"><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Donald J. Trump, one of the developers who initially fought the sprinkler law, said yesterday that he had decided to spend $3 million to install sprinklers in all 350 units of Trump World Tower, a high-rise apartment complex that he is building across from the United Nations.</span></p>\n<p id=\"story-continues-4\" class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"84\" data-total-count=\"4801\">But Mr. Trump stressed that he did not believe the law would reduce fire fatalities.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"5051\">”People feel safer with sprinklers,” he said. ”But the problem with the bill is that it doesn’t address the buildings that need sprinklers the most. If you look at the fire deaths in New York, almost all of them are in one- or two-family houses.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"5051\">The fact that Trump softened his stance on the installation of sprinklers and voluntarily invested in them for one of his buildings does not erase his earlier public opposition to them, but any discussion of his record on sprinklers in residential buildings is incomplete without mention of all these facts.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/donald-trump/\">donald trump</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fire-safety/\">fire safety</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/new-york-city/\">new york city</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/proud-snowflakes/\">proud snowflakes</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/new-york-usa-30-oct-2017-745206250\" target=\"_blank\">Inspired By Maps / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">11 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cummings, Julian; Gingras, Brynn.  “There Was No Working Smoke Alarm in the Trump Tower Apartment Where Deadly Fire Started, Sources Say.”<br>\n  <em>CNN</em>.  10 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Jacobs, Andrew.  “Man Killed in Brooklyn Fire as Panel Urges Sprinkler Law.”<br>\n  <em>New York Times</em>.  24 February 1999.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Wilgoren, Jodi; Lambert, Bruce.  “Fire Inquiry Prompts Focus on Inspections.”<br>\n  <em>New York Times</em>.  20 December 1998.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lambert, Bruce.  “Extent of Sprinkler Law at Issue as Fire’s Survivors Share Their Horror.”<br>\n <em>New York Times</em>.  9 January 1999.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Barry, Dan; Cooper, Michael.  “New Requirement for Sprinklers in Apartment Buildings is Likely.”<br>\n  <em>New York Times</em>.  30 December 1998.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>McCaffrey, Walter L.  “Local Law 10-1999.”<br>\n  <em>New York City Council</em>.  24 March 1999.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Herszenhorn, David M.  “Giuliani Signs Bill on Apartment-House Sprinklers.”<br>\n  <em>New York Times</em>.  25 March 1999.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "710"},

the deceased animal. This is an art installation that was created by <a href=\"http://media.greenpeace.org/archive/Whale-Art-Installation-in-the-Philippines-27MZIFJJULTID.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greenpeace Philippines</a> in May 2017 to “underscore the massive problem of plastics pollution in the ocean and calls on the ASEAN to address this looming problem on its shores.”</p>\n<p>This replica of a dead whale is entirely made of plastic debris that was found in the ocean, and is located at the Sea Side Beach Resort in <a href=\"http://cavite.gov.ph/home/cities-and-municipalities/municipality-of-naic/\" target=\"_blank\">Naic, Cavite</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As groups gathered to haul off the dead whale, they noticed that its entire body was made of plastic wastes found in the ocean. The slimy innards sprawling out of its underbelly was a mix of plastic bags, remains of plastic containers, sachets, bottles and more. Photos of this morose installation spiraled around social media on the day itself, sparking conversations on plastics pollution—a topic far different from the viral oarfish photos in Mindanao that were said to be a sign of the “end of the world”.</p>\n<p>THE CASE OF PLASTICS POLLUTION</p>\n<p>Just in the first quarter of 2016, already more than 30 dead sperm whales were found washed up in the shores of Europe, with large amounts of plastic waste in their stomachs. Late last year, one of them was found here in Samal, Davao. The reaction of locals was almost baffling as they simply collected the whale’s carcass and transported it to a local museum where they usually display beached sea creatures found in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/whale-replica-collage.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-136594\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/whale-replica-collage.jpg?resize=600,402\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/whale-replica-collage.jpg?w=1500 1500w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/whale-replica-collage.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/whale-replica-collage.jpg?resize=768,515 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/whale-replica-collage.jpg?resize=1024,687 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Authorities in Murcia, Spain did release a few <a href=\"http://www.laverdad.es/lospiesenlatierra/noticias/indigestion-plastico-mato-20180405010937-ntvo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photographs</a> of the actual whale that washed ashore in February 2018, as well as images of the 64 pounds of debris that was found in its stomach, which included ropes, plastic bags, nets, and a gas canister:  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/sperm-whale-collage.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-136603\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/sperm-whale-collage.jpg?resize=600,1042\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/sperm-whale-collage.jpg?w=802 802w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/sperm-whale-collage.jpg?resize=173,300 173w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/sperm-whale-collage.jpg?resize=768,1334 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/sperm-whale-collage.jpg?resize=590,1024 590w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>As can be seen in these photographs, the sperm whale was unusually thin.

A report from the <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">World Economic Forum</a> found that the amount of plastic in the ocean may outweigh fish by 2050:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plastic has been found to choke marine wildlife, and has also entered the ocean food chain — exposing marine life to toxic chemicals that can end up in the food on our plates. Around 150 million tons of plastic are already floating in our oceans — with an additional eight million tons entering the water each year, according to the World Economic Forum. It is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans by weight if current rates of plastic dumping hold.</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/art-installation/\">art installation</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/greenpeace/\">Greenpeace</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/philippines/\">Philippines</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/pollution/\">pollution</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/whales/\">whales</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Gabbatiss, Josh.   “Plastic Pollution Killed Sperm Whale Found Dead on Spanish Beach.”<br>\n    <em>CNN</em>.   7 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Said-Moorhouse, Lauren.   “Ocean Plastic Predicted to Triple Within a Decade.”<br>\n    <em>CNN</em>.   21 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Diaz, Andrea.   “A Sperm Whale That Washed Up on a Beach in Spain Had 64 Pounds of Plastic and Waste in its Stomach.”<br>\n    <em>CNN</em>.   11 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hamilton, Kristy.   “Post-Mortem On Thirteen Beached Sperm Whales Found Their Stomachs Full Of Plastic.”<br>\n    <em>IFL Science</em>.   28 March 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nace, Trevor.   “Yet Another Dead Whale Is Grave Reminder Of Our Massive Plastic Problem.”<br>\n    <em>Forbes</em>.   9 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ruiz, Miguel.   “Una Indigestión de Plástico Mató al Cachalote.”<br>\n    <em>La Verdad</em>.   5 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "1K"},

Early internet warnings made the same false or unproven claims about <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rash-decision-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huggies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rash-decision-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pampers</a> products. In this case, the original poster’s name was cropped out, and the post did not indicate how the chemical burn (purportedly diagnosed by a nameless pediatrician) was connected to the brand of diapers used and not some other irritant, such as laundry detergent or soap: \n<blockquote><p>This is what happened to Gunner’s leg after trying the parents choice pull ups. His pediatrician did confirm that he had a chemical burn. Please don’t buy these pull ups!!!</p>\n<p>Every one please share thus post so that parents can be warned</p></blockquote>\n<p>We were unable to find any type of recall, warning, or other information from the brand or consumer groups indicating that Parent’s Choice diapers or pull-ups were associated with chemical burns or a risk of skin reaction.</p>\n<p>Anecdotal reports of diaper-related chemical burns circulate for nearly every brand of diapers and wipes. The original post appears to have already been either removed or restricted, and it did not appear in a Facebook search. Neither was the date of the original post available, only the copy posted by the Facebook page “Smoove Element” in February 2016.</p>\n<p>As noted on an earlier page involving similar claims:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Children can and do develop severe cases of diaper rash and symptoms resembling chemical burns for a variety of reasons independent of what type or brand of diaper they use. To assume that an observed rash or burn in a diaper-wearing toddler must be directly and solely related to the brand of diaper worn without reproducible confirmatory evidence is an example of the <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> logical <a href=\"http://skepdic.com/posthoc.html\" target=\"_blank\">fallacy</a>.</p>\n<p>As well, to believe that a particular brand of disposable diaper poses a general danger of severely burning children in its ordinary use requires the additional beliefs that major companies who have been in the disposable diaper business for many years have suddenly unleashed new varieties of those products on the market without conducting the minimal testing necessary to uncover such issues, that the source of the reported hazard is obvious despite the fact that in-depth testing by government regulatory issues can’t uncover it, and that this looming danger threatens all children who wear a particular brand of disposable diaper even though only a relative handful of the millions of consumers who use the brand have reported such issues.</p>\n<p>A much more logical belief is that such cases, while real, are coincidental or only indirectly related to the brand of diaper used. Children may receive rashes and burns from other external sources unknown to their parents, such as exposure to caustic substances. Children may experience severe allergic reactions to something they’ve been exposed to (inside or outsider of their diapers). Children may develop cases of diaper rash so severe that they resemble chemical burns just as a matter of course and not because of the brand of diaper they’re wearing. Other contributory factors may also come into play that produce rash or burn-like effects in only a small number of cases, such as unrealized interactions with other household products (e.g., bleaches or cleaning agents), the content of a child’s excretions, children being left with unchanged diapers for far too long, or children experiencing some other type of medical issue that creates or exacerbates symptoms.</p>\n<p>Likewise, confirmation bias is strong in such cases. People report and pay attention to only those cases that fit the suspected pattern, while ignoring cases of parents who report the same symptoms even though their children don’t wear the identified type or brand of diapers, or parents who use the identified type or brand of diaper with no problems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We contacted Parent’s Choice to ask whether they had any information about reports of chemical burns associated with the products, or if there had been any recalls involving the brand. A spokesperson told us that although the recirculation of the Facebook post led to an increased level of concern and calls, there did not appear to be a rise in reported “chemical burns” associated with any Parent’s Choice diaper or wipes and no recalls had been issued.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/diapers/\">diapers</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/parents-choice/\">parent's choice</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/viral-facebook-posts/\">viral facebook posts</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/walmart/\">walmart</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Boyle, Matthew.   “Wal-Mart Spent A Year Remaking Diapers.”<br>\n    <em>Bloomberg</em>.   27 September 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "676"},

Recent evidence from animal and human studies shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to epilepsy and related conditions. Current evidence also shows that cannabidiol is not likely to be abused […]</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The ECDD therefore concluded that current information does not justify scheduling of cannabidiol and postponed a fuller review of cannabidiol preparations to May 2018, when the committee will undertake a comprehensive review of cannabis and cannabis related substances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">This opinion essentially allowed the question of how to schedule CBD preparations, whose legal status in the United States remains a <span class=\"s1\">complicated </span><a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/cbd-oil-legal-depends-ask\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">mess</span></a> to be separated from a larger question of cannabis preparations that <i>do</i> contain the psychoactive compound THC. On the international stage, that larger question will begin to be addressed in early <a href=\"http://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/ecdd_40_meeting/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">June 2018</span></a> during a meeting of the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The June 2018 meeting is dedicated entirely “to carrying out pre-reviews of cannabis and cannabis-related substances,” including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul><li class=\"p3\">Cannabis plant and cannabis resin</li>\n<li class=\"p3\">Extracts and tinctures of cannabis</li>\n<li class=\"p3\">Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)</li>\n<li class=\"p3\">Isomers of THC</li>\n</ul><p class=\"p1\">Under <a href=\"https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/marijuana/m_extract_7350.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">current</span></a> United States law, any preparation made from the Controlled Substance Act’s definition of cannabis would be considered the Schedule I drug marijuana, including any CBD oil derived from it. The definition is extremely broad, and it includes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\">All parts of the plant <i>Cannabis sativa L.</i>, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, many manufacturers of CBD oil claim that they make their product with hemp, which according to the <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr2642enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr2642enr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">2014 Farm Act</span></a> is a legal classification for “any part of [<i>Cannabis sativa L.</i>], whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis,” and which can be grown in states that allow its cultivation under federal law. In addition, <a href=\"https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=006473\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">several states</span></a> have passed laws allowing for the possession of CBD oil with minimal THC, even if that oil is derived from cannabis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Speaking to the apparent discrepancy between the legal definition of a cannabis product and the legal definition of hemp, DEA spokesperson Russ Baer <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/cbd-oil-legal-depends-ask\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">told</span></a> the cannabis-focused outlet Leafly.com in March 2017 that products derived from hemp are not controlled substances:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\">If the products are derived from the non-intoxicating part of the marijuana plant […] then you’re talking a non-controlled substance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ability to produce CBD from the “non-intoxicating” parts of the plant or from “hemp” at all is a <a href=\"https://www.projectcbd.org/about/cannabis-facts/sourcing-cbd-marijuana-industrial-hemp-vagaries-federal-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">controversial topic</span></a>, despite claims made by some manufacturers. These issues are likely to be among those discussed during the June WHO meeting.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In any event, the December 2017 WHO announcement declaring CBD safe has no legal bearing on its preparation and sale in the United States, and referred only to cannabidiol and not medical marijuana more broadly. Because of this, we rank this claim as mostly false.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/cannabidiol/\">cannabidiol</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/cannabis/\">cannabis</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/cbd/\">CBD</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+7 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/dea/\">DEA</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/drugs/\">drugs</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fda/\">FDA</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/marijuana/\">marijuana</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/medical-marijuana/\">medical marijuana</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/who/\">WHO</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/world-health-organization/\">World Health Organization</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/alex/\" class=\"author-link\">Alex Kasprak</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/flag-world-health-organization-3d-render-688544617\" target=\"_blank\">Capslock / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">11 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Malik, Fateh.   “The World Health Organization Just Declared Medicinal Marijuana Safe To Use.

Make the tax thingie go away.” No worries Ivanka, Daddy Trump made sure to exempt your super classy stretch denim clothing line from his tariffs. Only dirty farming communities and the peasants who labor in manufacturing will suffer. Kay, Princess? Keep making those plastic shoes and skinny jeans with slave labor, tariff-free, of course!</p></blockquote>\n<p>The claim that Ivanka Trump’s clothing line was spared from these tariffs is based on the fact that clothing items were not included on the list of some 1,300 products that will be subjected to these <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-administration-targets-chinese-electronics-aerospace-and-machinery-goods-with-50-billion-in-tariffs/2018/04/03/9be42e5e-3786-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">tariffs</a>. Although this means that Ivanka Trump’s brand will not have pay extra for clothing items imported from China, many of these stories omit the fact that no clothing company will:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In compiling the list, U.S. officials used algorithms to identify products that benefited from China’s state-directed campaign of technology acquisition while eliminating those whose inclusion would disrupt the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>The list was drafted to achieve “the lowest consumer impact,” according to Robert E. Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative. So, clothing and toys were excluded.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Office of the United States Trade Representative further <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Press/Releases/301FRN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explained</a> how some 1,300 products were chosen for the tariffs:  </p>\n<blockquote><p>Trade analysts from several U.S. Government agencies identified products that benefit from Chinese industrial policies, including Made in China 2025. The list was refined by removing specific products identified by analysts as likely to cause disruptions to the U.S. economy, and tariff lines that are subject to legal or administrative constraints. The remaining products were ranked according to the likely impact on U.S. consumers, based on available trade data involving alternative country sources for each product. The proposed list was then compiled by selecting products from the ranked list with lowest consumer impact.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Trump’s critics may claim that clothing items were excluded from these tariffs for nepotistic reasons, but the Office of the United States Trade Representative explanation does hold water. Imposing tariffs on clothing items from China would have a large <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-u-s-gets-its-clothing-one-year-after-the-bangladesh-factory-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">effect</a> on United States consumers.

However, Environmental Defense Fund scientist Tim Fitzgerald told the <em>New York Times</em> in 2014 that fish farming practices have been improving, and alert consumers can find “healthy and eco-friendly farmed options” by choosing their merchants carefully. Fitzgerald recommended aiming for a mix of both wild and farmed seafood for best results.</p>\n<p>Tilapia fish are mostly vegetarian and subsist on algae and freshwater plants in the wild, although, as the meme indicates, under aquacultural conditions they are fed corn and soybeans. Given that the vast <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453016300076\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">majority</a> of corn and soybean varieties grown worldwide are now genetically manipulated to be herbicide-tolerant and insect resistant, unless otherwise labeled the likelihood that farm-raised tilapia have eaten genetically modified products is quite high.</p>\n<p>There is no scientific evidence to support the assumption that feeding farm-raised tilapia genetically engineered products makes the fish unsafe for humans to consume, however. In an article published on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) web site, Iowa State University food scientist Ruth S. MacDonald <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/stakeholders/downloads/2015/coexistence/Ruth-MacDonald.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes</a> that there is no evidence that altered DNA from GMO feed is transferred to the animals that consume it, nor that GMO foods generally pose a health risk to human beings. The scientific <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/once-again-us-expert-panel-says-genetically-engineered-crops-are-safe-eat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consensus</a> on GMO safety remains strong.</p>\n<p>The claim that eating tilapia “is worse than eating bacon or a hamburger” appears to have been gleaned from <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/tilapia-is-worse-than-bacon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web</a> <a href=\"https://draxe.com/eating-tilapia-is-worse-than-eating-bacon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sites</a> reacting to a 2008 <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002822308005154#bib24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> pointing out that farm-raised tilapia offers a less desirable ratio of health-promoting omega-3 fatty acids to potentially inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids. A <a href=\"http://www.wakehealth.edu/News-Releases/2008/Wake_Forest_Researchers_Say_Popular_Fish_Contains_Potentially_Dangerous_Fatty_Acid_Combination.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">summary</a> of the research said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“For individuals who are eating fish as a method to control inflammatory diseases such as heart disease, it is clear from these numbers that tilapia is not a good choice,” the article says. <strong>“All other nutritional content aside, the inflammatory potential of hamburger and pork bacon is lower than the average serving of farmed tilapia.”</strong></p>\n<p>The article notes that the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, known scientifically as “long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids” (PUFAs), have been well documented. The American Heart Association now recommends that everyone eat at least two servings of fish per week, and that heart patients consume at least 1 gram a day of the two most critical omega-3 fatty acids, known as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid).</p>\n<p>But, the article says, the recommendation by the medical community for people to eat more fish has resulted in consumption of increasing quantities of fish such as tilapia that may do more harm than good, because they contain high levels of omega-6 fatty acids, also called n-6 PUFAs, such as arachidonic acid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We hasten to note that there is an obvious difference between saying that the inflammatory potential of hamburger and bacon is lower than that of tilapia, and saying that eating tilapia is “worse” than eating those other foods. More importantly, the overall implications of the study have been challenged by other experts. Sanford Health nutrition researcher William S. Harris <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081120163448/http://www.sanfordhealth.org/VisitorsPatients/HealthResources/HealthArticles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> that despite its particular fatty acid content, eating tilapia is still a healthy choice, and replacing it with bacon, hamburgers, or donuts is “absolutely not recommended”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eating fish, especially oily fish, at least twice per week is recommended for heart disease prevention. Fish is low in total and saturated fats, high in protein and essential trace minerals, and contains long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Oily fish rich in these healthy omega-3s include salmon, trout, albacore tuna, sardines, anchovies, mackerel and herring. Our omega-3 needs can also be met by eating less-oily (lower-fat) fish more often.</p>\n<p>Tilapia and catfish are examples of lower-fat fish that have fewer omega-3s than the oily fish listed above, but still provide more of these heart-healthy nutrients than hamburger, steak, chicken, pork or turkey. Actually, a 3 ounce serving of these fish provides over 100 mg of the long chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Considering that this is about the current daily intake of these fatty acids in the U.S., even these fish should be considered better choices than most other meat alternatives. Since they are also relatively low in total and saturated fats and high in protein, they clearly can be part of a healthy diet.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Flap_over_tilapia_sends_the_wrong_message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According</a> to Walter C. Willett, professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, the authors of the tilapia study overlooked the established health benefits of omega-6 fatty acids:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]he notion that omega-6 fats are bad just hasn’t panned out. For one thing, how the body uses arachidonic acid doesn’t depend on the ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats. For another, the argument overlooks the other good things that omega-6 fats do. These include lowering LDL and triglycerides, boosting protective HDL, and helping control blood sugar by making muscle cells respond more readily to insulin.</p>\n<p>In fact, “the doubling of the intake of omega-6 fat in the American diet since 1960 is one reason why heart disease deaths have declined since then,” says Heart Letter advisor Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As to the claim that “dioxin is found in this fish,” while it’s accurate to say that the toxic (and sometimes carcinogenic) chemical compounds known as dioxins sometimes turn up in both wild and farmed seafood (as they do in other foods), we came up short when we looked for proof that dioxins are found in tilapia more often than in any other seafood. Exposure to industrial contaminants such as dioxins is likely to vary according to where (i.e., in what countries) the fish are harvested.</p>\n<p>At least one scientific <a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> found that farmed fish such as tilapia are no more prone to contamination by dioxins (or mercury, for that matter) than wild-caught specimens. Another <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702431/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> found that tilapia, like other smaller, relatively short-lived species, are less likely to accumulate such contaminants in their flesh than larger, longer-lived species such as salmon.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that none of the supposed justifications for avoiding tilapia or claiming that “it’s killing our families” hold water. To the contrary, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included tilapia in its 2017 <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/UCM536321.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list</a> of “best choices” for seafood consumption by pregnant women and children, recommending two to three servings per week.

The article spread widely once again in April 2018. </p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>A representative <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/pope-francis-requests-roman-catholic-priests-given-right-get-married-163603054.html\" target=\"_blank\">article’s</a> headline reads: “Pope Francis requests Roman Catholic priests be given the right to get married.” However, the rather broad implications of this statement are contrasted with the more conditional, limited description presented in the article itself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm\" data-reactid=\"22\">The request applies to priests in Brazil, and is on the agenda for an upcoming synod (church council) in the Amazon region. The controversial move would address the critical shortage of men joining the priesthood — but is likely to drive divisions through the church by enraging conservative factions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In reality, Pope Francis has not made any public statement calling for or requesting broad marriage rights for all Catholic priests. Rather, others within the church hierarchy have reported that Francis has responded favorably to requests from bishops and cardinals that the church consider the possibility that already-married older men might, in limited circumstances, be ordained as Catholic priests — but only in Brazil, and only as a possible solution to the practical problem of a shortage in priests in Amazonian regions. </p>\n<p>In December 2016, the <em>National Catholic Reporter</em> <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/brazil-may-soon-have-married-priests-says-leonardo-boff\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> comments made by the theologian Leonardo Boff, who claimed that Brazilian bishops, facing a severe shortage of priests, had requested that Pope Francis allow married, older men to be ordained as priests:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pope Francis may soon fulfill the Brazilian bishops’ special request to allow married priests to resume their priestly ministry, liberation theologian Leonardo Boff said in a Dec. 25 <a href=\"https://www.ksta.de/kultur/leonardo-boff-im-interview--papst-franziskus-ist-einer-von-uns--25372660\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> in the German daily <em>Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger</em>.</p>\n<p>“The Brazilian bishops, especially the pope’s close friend Cardinal Claudio Hummes, have expressly requested Pope Francis to enable married priests in Brazil to return to their pastoral ministry,” Boff said. “I have recently heard that the pope wants to fulfil this request — as an experimental, preliminary phase for the moment confined to Brazil.”</p>\n<p>With its 140 million Catholics, Brazil needs at least 100,000 priests but it only has 18,000, which is a “catastrophe,” Boff said. “No wonder the faithful are going over to the evangelical churches or to the Pentecostals in droves, as they are filling the personnel vacuum. If the many thousands of priests who have married are once again allowed to practice their ministry, that would be a first step to improving the situation but at the same time also an impulse for the church to free itself of the fetters of celibacy.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>A year later, the issue made news once again, after Brazilian cardinal Claudio Hummes told the Italian newspaper<em> Il Messaggero</em> that Francis had agreed to propose a debate on allowing married men to be ordained in the Amazonian region at an October 2019 meeting of bishops. </p>\n<p>In November 2017, the <em>Catholic News Agency</em> <a href=\"https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/despite-reports-pope-francis-isnt-opening-the-door-to-all-married-priests-81711\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pope Francis has reportedly said he will allow for debate as to whether married men could be ordained to the priesthood in the region during a 2019 Synod of Bishops focusing on the Church in the Amazon basin.</p>\n<p>His comments came in response to a question on the matter from Cardinal Claudio Hummes, the president of the Episcopal Commission for the Amazon, according to the newspaper Il Messaggero.</p>\n<p>The comments have been broadly interpreted in media outlets to mean that Pope Francis is considering opening the door for priests throughout the Roman Catholic Church to get married. However, the Pope’s comments in response to Cardinal Hummes were specifically about whether “viri probati” or “proven men” could be ordained to the priesthood. Such men, who have displayed virtue and prudence, are thought by some to be a possible solution to a shortage of priestly vocations in Brazil.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In an interview with German newspaper<em> Die Zeit </em>in March 2017, Pope Francis himself had already left open the possibility that the principle of “viri probati” might be implemented in certain remote areas. In comments <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/c933d61ff7424240b7696c691e116bef\" target=\"_blank\">translated</a> by the <em>Associated Press</em>, Francis said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We must consider if viri probati is a possibility. Then we must determine what tasks they can perform, for example, in remote communities.</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/catholic-church/\">catholic church</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/catholicism/\">catholicism</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/marriage/\">marriage</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/pope-francis/\">pope francis</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/priests/\">priests</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/rome-italy-april-04-his-holiness-561912127\" target=\"_blank\">Boris Stroujko / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pongratz-Lippitt, Christa.  “Brazil May Soon Have Married Priests, Says Leonardo Boff.”<br>\n  <em>National Catholic Reporter</em>.  30 December 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Frank, Joachim.  “Leonardo Boff im Interview: ‘Papst Franziskus ist Einer von Uns.”<br>\n <em> Kölner-Stadt-Anzeiger</em>.  25 December 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rezac, Mary.  “Despite Reports, Pope Francis Isn’t Opening the Door to All Married Priests.”<br>\n  <em>Catholic News Agency/EWTN News</em>.  5 November 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Giansoldati, Franca.  “I Vescovi Brasiliani: Aprire ai Preti Sposati.”<br>\n  <em>Il Messaggero</em>.  2 November 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Associated Press.  “Pope Open to Studying Ordination of Married Men as Priests.”<br>\n  <em>Associated Press</em>.  9 March 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "256"},

That rumor, too, was likely either embellished or <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-pope-say-hell-doesnt-exist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">misreported</a>.</p>\n<p>Pope Francis does have somewhat of a history of making controversial <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/19/living/pope-said-what/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statements</a> that are seemingly at odds with traditional church teachings:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In politics, they call it going “off message.” In acting, they call it going “off script.” In the Catholic Church under Pope Francis, it has become “business as usual.”</p>\n<p>Put the 81-year-old pontiff in front of a microphone, and he will make news.</p>\n<p>Case in point: During a 2015 brief press conference aboard the papal plane from the Philippines to Rome, when Francis sounded off in his very unpope-like way on birth control, corruption and kicking grifters where the sun don’t shine.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although this has caused some genuine concern among religious leaders, it has also spawned rumors that the Pope was deliberately trying to undermine the church. This theory was summed up by the conspiracy theorist blog YourNewsWire.com in an <a href=\"https://archive.li/ZqD5w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> appearing to report that Pope Francis said that his word “overruled” anything written in the Bible:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pope Francis has responded to claims that many of his teachings “contradict Bible teachings” by saying that his words “overrule” anything written in the Bible.</p>\n<p>The pope has further angered traditional Christians in recent weeks by developing the habit of hiding the crucifix that is worn around his neck when speaking in public, causing many Christians to believe the pontiff is ashamed to display the powerful Christian symbol.</p></blockquote>\n<p>YourNewsWire.com<em> </em>placed the word “overrule” in quotes in both their title and opening sentence, but they never provide the actual quote in which Pope Francis allegedly expressed this belief.  It also posted several photographs of the pontiff, using them to claim that he purposefully hides the crucifix on his neck while in public because he is ashamed of the religious symbol:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But Pope Francis is so ashamed of our Lord Jesus Christ that he concealed his pectoral cross from Jews by stuffing it into his fascia or waist sash.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These photographs, however, appear to show cherry-picked moments when his cross slips behind his clothing. For example, this web site claimed that Pope Francis hid his cross during a kosher luncheon he hosted in January 2014 for a group of rabbis from Argentina. Although the image they provided appears to be genuine (left), other <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/01/20/pope-goes-kosher/4668815/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">images</a> from this event show the Pope wearing his cross in full view:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/pope-cross-comparison.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135661\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/pope-cross-comparison.jpg?resize=600,215\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/pope-cross-comparison.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/pope-cross-comparison.jpg?resize=300,108 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/pope-cross-comparison.jpg?resize=768,276 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Likewise, this web site provided three more images which purportedly showed the pope hiding his cross during a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel’s memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, in 2014.

According to a statement provided to us by Weber’s office:</p>\n<blockquote><p>AB 931 authorizes police officers to use deadly force only when it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily injury or death – that is, if, given the totality of the circumstances, there was no reasonable alternative to using deadly force, including warnings, verbal persuasion, or other nonlethal methods of resolution or de-escalation.</p>\n<p>This bill also establishes that a homicide by a peace officer is not justified if the officer’s gross negligence contributed to making the force “necessary.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>But conservative blog The Maven argued in a post that the measure would lead to officers being “judged in hindsight” regarding the use of force:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For example, if a suspect pulls a pellet gun on an officer, they are not actually presenting a deadly threat. The officer would have no reasonable way to know that the gun isn’t a lethal firearm, but under the new law, they could be charged if they shoot that suspect.</p>\n<p>This law would also appear to apply if somebody pulled an unloaded gun on an officer, or drew a malfunctioning gun. In these circumstance, unbeknownst to the officer, the suspect is not actually presenting a deadly threat. If the officer reasonably responds by shooting that person, they could be criminally charged.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A spokesperson for Weber, Joe Kocurek, rejected that reasoning in an e-mail to us. Kocurek said that the bill only changed the standard for authorizing the use of deadly force from whenever it was “reasonable” to cases when it was “necessary,” adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whether officers’ use of deadly force was necessary would still be evaluated based on the facts available to them at the time. For example, if police were dealing with an individual who had a pellet gun or unloaded gun that was indistinguishable from a real gun, under the bill, officers’ use of force would still be evaluated based on the officers’ understanding that the person had a real gun — but the evaluation would ask if, given the belief that the person had a gun, was the use of deadly force necessary, or could the officer have used de-escalation techniques to defuse the situation or alternatives to deadly force.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The bill has already been endorsed by the California chapters of both the Black Lives Matter movement and the American Civil Liberties Union, among other social justice groups. It has also been opposed by unions representing police officers; Los Angeles Police Protective League president Craig Lally <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-police-shooting-legislation-20180403-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that AB 931 “will either get cops killed or allow criminals to terrorize our streets unchecked” if passed.</p>\n<p>Clark’s shooting has inspired a spate of <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/articles/2018/04/04/updates-large-stephon-clark-shooting-demonstration-in-downtown-sacramento-on-anniversary-of-mlk-jr-assassination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protests</a> in Sacramento, with demonstrators calling for charges to be filed against the officers who killed him.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/california/\">california</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/guns/\">guns</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/police-shootings/\">police shootings</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/stephon-clark/\">stephon clark</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/bb-gungas-airsoft-pistol-bullets-on-517406314\" target=\"_blank\">phanu suwannarat / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Otiko, Manny. “CA Legislators Announce Plan to Restrict Police Use of Deadly Force.”<br>\n<em>    Sacramento Observer.</em> 4 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dillon, Liam. “After Stephon Clark Shooting, California Lawmakers Push to Make it Easier to Prosecute Police Officers.”<br>\n<em>    Los Angeles Times.</em> 3 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Romero, Ezra David. “Black Lives Matter Sacramento Says It Will Protest Stephon Clark Shooting Three Days A Week — Indefinitely — Until They ‘Get Justice.'”<br>\n<em>    Capital Public Radio.</em> 4 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "143"},

The fact that Cooper and Mitchell are both dead is not mentioned until the story’s penultimate paragraph.</p>\n<p>Despite stating in its headline that Aldrin (who piloted the Apollo 11 mission in 1969)  passed a “lie detector test,” the <em>Star</em> reported that the four astronauts’ “participation” consisted of an alleged analysis of recordings of the two men’s voices. But there is no mention of which recordings were covered by the “complex computer analyses” of their voice patterns; instead, the <em>Star</em> reported that “these studies are claimed to be more reliable than current lie detector tests and could soon replace those used by the FBI and police,” without stating exactly <em>who</em> is making said claim:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aldrin has always maintained he spotted a UFO on the way to the moon, saying: “There was something out there that was close enough to be observed, sort of L-shaped.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The tabloid also reported that Sharry Edwards, who heads the Ohio-based institute, said that even though Aldwin “cannot explain it,” he is somehow sure that he saw a non-terrestrial spacecraft. But the tabloid did not mention that Aldrin himself <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2a5vg8/i_am_buzz_aldrin_engineer_american_astronaut_and/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” chat session on 8 July 2014 that what he saw was likely not anything extraterrestrial:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world – it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don’t know. So technically, the definition could be “unidentified.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>We reached out to Aldrin seeking comment but did not hear back prior to publication; a spokesperson for him <a href=\"https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/buzz-aldrin-definitely-saw-aliens-he-passed-a-lie-detector-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> the Australian web site <em>Pedestrian,</em> “This is bogus and we don’t know where it came from.”</p>\n<p>Aldrin’s spokesperson also emailed us to rebut the allegation, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Buzz did not take a lie detector test. He has never said he saw a UFO. This story has been a fabrication for the sake of headlines and is not true as far as Buzz Aldrin is concerned. We think they’ve twisted one of his interviews to mean something it does not. Buzz has always been very clear that he never saw any UFO’s or anything to indicate we’ve been contacted by alien life. So this is someone just trying to capitalize on using his name to get press.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bioacoustics — the institute’s alleged field of expertise — is a legitimate realm of scientific study, dating back to the work of biologist Ivan Regen in 1925. But as ScienceAlert.com once <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/buzz-aldrin-ufo-moon-apollo-mission-lie-detector-aliens-bioacoustics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> of Edwards’ group, “the institute’s line of study bears the hallmarks of pseudoscience.”</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Update [9 April 2018]: Updated with a comment from a spokesperson for Buzz Aldrin.</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/aliens/\">aliens</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/buzz-aldrin/\">buzz aldrin</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/extraterrestrials/\">extraterrestrials</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/moon-landing/\">moon landing</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/ufos/\">UFOs</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/nyc-nov-11-astronaut-buzz-aldrin-115837888\" target=\"_blank\">MISHELLA / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bruce-Smith, Alex. “Totally Legit Report Says Buzz Aldrin Saw Aliens When He Was Up In Space.”<br>\n<em>    Pedestrian.</em> 9 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I am Buzz Aldrin, engineer, American astronaut, and the second person to walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 moon landing.

Although news reports at the time reported that Roy and Unger “played” a game of tennis, we are slightly skeptical, given the laws of physics, that they were actually hitting and returning serves. </p>\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/327200226/?terms=ivan+unger+tennis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blurb</a> about the stunt published in the <em>Tampa Morning Tribune</em> in November 1925:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/unger-and-roy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135471\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/unger-and-roy.jpg?resize=600,485\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/unger-and-roy.jpg?w=707 707w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/unger-and-roy.jpg?resize=300,243 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>On the wings of a speeding plane, 3,000 feet in the air above Los Angles Glady Roy, aviatrix, and Ivan Unger attempted a tennis match. There was no umpire, and the players did not say whether they went after the balls that were batted out of bounds.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The stunt was performed on the wings of an Curtis JN-4 “Jenny” plane piloted by Jack Tomac, which had a <a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/current/airmail-in-america/the-airplanes/the-curtiss-jenny.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top speed</a> of about 80 mph. Even at this relatively low speed, however, the physics of hitting a ball back and fourth would be problematic. Furthermore, since this stunt was performed thousands of feet above the spectators, there was no real need to use a tennis ball, as it would be difficult to see from the ground. </p>\n<p>Indeed, a site dedicated to aviation pioneers Jack and Helen Fryer noted that this <a href=\"http://www.sedonalegendhelenfrye.com/1928.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tennis</a> match was played without a ball:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tennis anyone? Well Gladys Roy and Ivan Unger did so regularly- just at 3000 feet, where it was assumed the air was crisper. Of course, sans the tennis balls, as retrieving an “out of bounds” tennis ball meant landing first. Frank Tomac was the pilot on many of these matches, one recorded on October 25, 1925, for the Movie house Newsreels.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The tennis game may have been staged, but the stunt was real. A second photograph available via <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/515134376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getty Images</a> shows Unger (foreground) and Roy (background) in slightly different positions (a tennis ball can’t be spotted in either picture):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/plane-stunt.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135467\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/plane-stunt.jpg?resize=600,211\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/plane-stunt.jpg?w=2522 2522w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/plane-stunt.jpg?resize=300,105 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/plane-stunt.jpg?resize=768,270 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/plane-stunt.jpg?resize=1024,359 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Unger was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oAzdbd0J2A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well-known</a> barnstorming troupe known as the <a href=\"http://www.famefarm.com/main%2013.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">13 Black Cats</a>. It’s unclear if Roy was ever considered an official member of the group, but she did perform alongside them on occasion and made a name for herself by doing the Charleston on the wings of a plane. According to her <a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/gladys-roy-collection-1911-1927\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letterhead</a>, Roy also held the <a href=\"https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/tennis-anyone-7859617/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">record</a> for the “world’s lowest parachute jump” from just 100 feet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/gladys-roy-collection-1911-1927\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roy</a> talked about some of her stunts in a May 1926 profile <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/380625016/?terms=Gladys+Roy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> in the <em>Los Angeles Times:</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>I do everything from the Charleston to playing tennis on the wings of a speeding ship, to hanging by my legs from the landing gear as the ship comes to earth. The moment my fingers touch the earth i snap my body upwards and the plane alights in a cloud of dust.</p>\n<p>It looks ten times more thrilling than it really is because the crowd cannot see me on account of the dust cloud. Of late, the crowds are beginning to tire of even my most difficult stunts and so I must necessarily invent new ones, that is, if I want to hold my reputation as a dare-devil.</p>\n<p>Eventually an accident will occur and then …</p>\n<p>The exhibitors know and welcome these accidents, for their ears are turned to the clink of gold as it falls into their strong boxes. Thus does the event spell success or failure.</p>\n<p>Were one to turn back the pages of this world they would have probably found me again in the Roman circus. I would have been crying: “Hail, Caesar! We who are about to die, salute thee! And promoter Caesar would have turned ‘thumbs down.'”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sadly, after all of her high-flying stunts, Roy’s life was cut tragically short in 1927 when she was <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/127763084/?terms=gladys%2Broy%2Bpropeller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">struck</a> by a propeller at the end of a photoshoot:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Miss Roy had climbed into the plane to have her picture taken with an Ohio bathing beauty who won a place to compete in the Atlantic City annual bathing beauty contest.

Cunningham, 35, a team lead with CDC’s Division of Population Health, went missing on February 12th, according to Atlanta police, with family and police desperate for answers regarding his sudden disappearance.</p>\n<p>In January, Dr. Cunningham shared his opinion that this year’s flu shot was behind the deadly outbreak of the flu, while warning that if his name was attached to the widely-circulated quotes, he would lose his job – or suffer an even worse fate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is true that the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/ap/2018/04/05/police-missing-cdc-workers-body-recovered-atlanta-river/\" target=\"bo\">body</a> of Timothy Cunningham, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was found in an Atlanta river more than six weeks after he was reported missing. (The circumstances of his drowning death have not yet been determined.)</p>\n<p>However, no credible information documents that Dr. Cunningham had opined that flu shots were actually responsible creating a flu epidemic. Your News Wire is a <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/yournewswire/\" target=\"fa\">fake news</a> site that has published multiple false articles about the alleged deleterious effects of <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-cdc-flu-shot-causing-outbreak/\" target=\"fl\">flu shots</a>, and their “reporting” in this case cited nothing other than their own fabricated material.</p>\n<p>As Atlanta television station WXIA <a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/verify/verify-heres-why-the-missing-cdc-scientist-is-not-a-flu-vaccine-whistle-blower/85-526924985\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>, Your News Wire’s account was “hollow of credible sources and verified facts” and included multiple false statements. Moreover, Dr. Cunningham did not deal with infectious diseases and did not have access to sensitive information in that area:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Cunningham’s disappearance] led conspiracy theorists to spin fantastic rumors online.</p>\n<p>Some claimed he knew the cure to cancer. Most believed he was holding back a CDC bombshell: that the flu vaccine caused the current epidemic.</p>\n<p>Our researchers traced that claim back to an article on a site called YourNewsWire.com from January 2018. The article quoted an anonymous CDC doctor who said, “we have seen people dying across the country of the flu, and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot.” While the article doesn’t name Cunningham, some are outing him as the Whistleblower, saying it was too convenient he went missing.</p>\n<p>YourNewsWire.com made several false statements in their article including that the flu vaccine is only 10 percent effective (it’s not — it’s 36% effective according to health officials) and that 2018 has been the deadliest flu season (it hasn’t — in 1918 the epidemic killed millions according to National Archives).</p>\n<p>The article says not to trust ‘Big Pharma’ and the ‘Mainstream Media.’ It was hollow of credible sources and verified facts.</p>\n<p>We checked with police and they say they are aware of these conspiracies. They say Cunningham wasn’t authorized to see classified information.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Cunningham worked in the chronic disease unit, which is not the infectious disease unit, he had no access to classified material,” [Major Michael] O’Connor [of the Atlanta Police Department] said.”[The CDC doesn’t] believe that his employment would be cause for something like that to occur because he simply doesn’t have access to those types of things.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/\" class=\"author-link\">David Mikkelson</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Harris, Niamh.   “Body of CDC Doctor Who Exposed Flu Shot Found Floating in River.”<br>\n    <em>Your News Wire</em>.   5 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Block, Eliana.   “Here’s Why the Missing CDC Scientist Is Not a Flu Vaccine Whistle Blower.”<br>\n    <em>WXIA-TV</em> [Atlanta].   8 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "1K"},

That post makes the claim that the rock shown was first discovered by soldiers who found that placing their guns near the stone caused them to melt, suggesting that the truth about this mysterious stone needed to be unearthed:</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" data-src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fclipdang%2Fvideos%2F581313022231990%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=273\" width=\"273\" height=\"476\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><noscript><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fclipdang%2Fvideos%2F581313022231990%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=273\" width=\"273\" height=\"476\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></noscript>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is a highly dubious narrative for several reasons. Liquid iron or steel (the iron-based metal most <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/nail-fastener\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">commonly</span></a> used to make nails) would be molten red if it were in liquid form, not bright silver as in the video, for one thing. In addition to the immutable laws of physical chemistry, claims that this rock is dissolving a typical nail are dubious, as well, because the video is showing a fairly obvious science parlor trick.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The metal used here is almost certainly gallium, which is <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=melting+point+gallium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">solid</span></a> at room temperature, but melts at around 85.6ºF (29.8ºC). A <a href=\"http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=3873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">black</span></a> stone sitting in the sun could easily reach this temperature and cause the gallium to liquify. Further, making gallium nails is both easy to do, and something for which there are directions on the internet. This YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SGscd2KIjE&amp;index=13&amp;list=PL-usz6aw13OVQh4CCexK8Kd63iZ52fSN6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">video</span></a>, for example, shows an experiment in which a person creates a gallium nail and hammers it into a piece of wood — before melting the nail away with a hair dryer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The conclusion that the Facebook video shows a gallium nail dissolving is further supported by the fact that the person handling the nail in the viral video is using a latex glove — a protective measure both because the heat of someone’s hand would melt the gallium fairly quickly, and because gallium, while generally safe, can <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/gallium#section=Safety-and-Hazards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">irritate</span></a> the skin upon contact.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For these reasons we rank the claim that the video shows a traditional nail being melted or dissolved by a rock as false. The video most likely shows a gallium nail crafted specifically for the purpose of showing a science experiment. </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/clipdang/\">clipdang</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gallium/\">gallium</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/iron/\">iron</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+4 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/magic/\">magic</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/science/\">science</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/steel/\">steel</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/stone/\">stone</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/alex/\" class=\"author-link\">Alex Kasprak</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">10 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Clipdang (Facebook)</em>.   ”<br>\n•หินกินเหล็กอยู่ที่พม่าครับ เจอโดยทหารกระเหรี่ยงเอาปืนวางใกล้ๆแล้วปืนละลายครับ เป็นหน้าที่ของผู้รู้ที่จะสืบเสาะหาความจริงต่อไป”<br>\n    6 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>.   “Nail Fastener”<br>\n    Accessed 10 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>UCSB Science Line</em>.   “Why Do Black Objects Absorb More Heat (Light) Than Lighter Colored Objects?”<br>\n    3 March 2013.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>ActionLab Vlogs (YouTube)</em>.   “Liquid Metal Nails | Making A Gallium Nail.”<br>\n    28 September 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Pubchem</em>.   “Gallium, Safety and Hazards”<br>\n    Accessed 10 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "137"},

I joined this college a virgin though I have had boyfriends before,my parents are strict so having sex was never on my mind.</p>\n<p>Septmber 22nd, 2013, is a day I will never forget,we went clubbing in town and got drunk with some senior students then went back hostels for party around 2am</p>\n<p>I remember waking up naked to a guy called Javan with my private part painful and I realised he had sex with me when I was drunk. I only asked if he used a condom and he said yes.</p>\n<p>However, when taking bathIi noticed sperms down there,i wanted to commit suicide,i feared getting pregnant and HIV, I took drug and hoped i was HIV free.</p>\n<p>In November, I tested HIV positive,I felt like cutting off my neck. I confronted theguy and he insisted he was clean that I got it from somewhere.</p>\n<p>I was so depressed and took alcohol to die. I even bought poison,the pain was just unbearable. How was I gonna face the world? I let my parents down. I gave up on the world and just wanted to end my life.</p>\n<p>Something came up in my mind that I should revenge. I hated men and I didn’t want to be near anymore. My future had been ruined, somehow someone had to pay.</p>\n<p>After a private therapy sessions, I gained strength not even my parents,friends knew of my conditions even up to now.</p>\n<p>I accepted my fate and promised to make all men I come across suffer. i know I am attractive and both married and unmarried men chase me left, right and center, luckily, my body has remained good and if anything my curves got better something you men like.</p>\n<p>I buried the good girl in me and became the bad girl. My goal was to infect as many as possible. So far, since December up to now, I have infected 324 men and I make sure to note down there list which I secretly keep. I plan to release it when I wiil be on my death bed.</p>\n<p>I know I have nothing left to do on earth but to wait for my death but before i do, men will get it.</p>\n<p>My target is over 2000 by the end of the year, pregnancy is out of question because I am on contraceptives. So I just do raw which most men here love. They don’t even question becauase my looks and body work greatly for me.</p>\n<p>Out of the 324 I have infected so far, about 156 are students here at the college, the remaining are married men outside, lecturers,lawyers,some celebs and 3 politicians. Not a day passes without me having sex, mostly four people per day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is an unverified story from an anonymous author that was posted to a Facebook page seemingly dedicated to scandals and rumors. The story itself is also rather preposterous. For one, how does this woman know how many people she infected? After all, having unprotected sex with someone who is HIV-positive does not automatically mean that the disease will <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/17877-hiv-transmission-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spread</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A heterosexual person infected with HIV will transmit the virus to their partner once in every 900 times the couple has unprotected sex, according to a new study conducted in Africa.</p>\n<p>However, the exact number of sexual acts that are needed to transmit the virus can vary tremendously depending on the amount of the virus in the infected person’s blood, said study researcher James Hughes, of the University of Washington in Seattle.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unless this anonymous woman accompanied her victims to the hospital after every sexual encounter for testing after a set period of time, there’s no way she would know how many people she had given HIV. </p>\n<p>The web site “<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140930095824/http://www.makekenyabetter.com/2014/03/kabarak-lady-gossip-is-a-scam-want-to-know-why/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Make Kenya Better</a>” took a closer look at some of the more specific claims in the story. Daniel Kibet, who was reportedly in his final year at Kabarak University when this rumor started to circulate, said that the school’s strict rules on gender segregation, the relatively small student population, and the fact that this woman was claiming she had more than three sexual partners per day for three months made this story completely implausible:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In her story there are some gaps and misinformation that gave us an impression she was lying about everything.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>In Kabarak main campus, men are banned from ladies hostels and if any man is found loitering around the ladies hostels then he or she would be suspended from school.</p>\n<p>So the part where she said that they went back to the hostels and had an after party after partying in Nakuru town is All FALSE.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>December has 31 days, January has 31 days and February has 28 days. If you add up the days you will end up with 90 days exactly. And the lady said she has infected 324 men from December. Let’s do the math.</p>\n<p>If you divide you will get 3.6 that is 3 different dudes per day.</p>\n<p>You will ask yourself is she a prostitute or what? How can a university student who has classes and assignments have time to f**k 3 dudes in one day.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Problems With Subsequent Postings</strong></p>\n<p>There are several other factors that point to this being a fearmongering rumor, as opposed to a genuine story about sexual revenge. For one thing, as this rumor was passed from disreputable web site to spurious blog, the accompanying photograph seemed to change. Many of these outlets claimed that images were culled from this woman’s Facebook profile. This is suspicious, however, as the woman’s identity was supposedly never revealed. Furthermore, we’ve seen <a href=\"http://straightfromlasgidi.blogspot.com/2014/03/kenyan-female-undergraduate-confesses.html#more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photographs</a> of <a href=\"https://notallowedto.com/hiv-positive-women-infects-324-men-with-hiv-as-revenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">least</a> <a href=\"http://now8news.com/girl-infects-586-men-hiv-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">five</a> different <a href=\"http://americansperspective.com/19-year-old-female-infected-324-men-hiv-reason/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">women</a> used to spread the hoax:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/not-samesies.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135376\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/not-samesies.jpg?resize=600,133\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/not-samesies.jpg?w=1799 1799w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/not-samesies.jpg?resize=300,67 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/not-samesies.jpg?resize=768,171 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/not-samesies.jpg?resize=1024,228 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Theses images were taken from dating profiles, porn <a href=\"http://resizing.info/edit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web</a> sites, and social media posts (such as this one, which is decidedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gunplaykitty/status/467532963941740545\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not safe</a> for work). However, we couldn’t connect any of these images to a 19-year-old student in Kenya. </p>\n<p>Another clue that this rumor is based more on fear than facts is that it receives minor updates with each passing year. In addition to changing the photograph, these sites have also altered the number of men reportedly infected with HIV by this woman, as well as her <a href=\"http://butthatsnoneofmybusiness.com/37544-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goal</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNGQA4QlHM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">date</a> for completing her revenge.</p>\n<p>For example, the disreputable blog <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/now8news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Now8News</a> rehashed this story, but claimed in their title that the woman had now infected 586 men (not 324) and that she planned on infecting more than 2000 by the end of <a href=\"http://now8news.com/girl-infects-586-men-hiv-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2018</a>, not 2014. Interestingly, the body of that article still said that this took place in 2017, which must have been a holdover from the previous year’s piece: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Social networks have been buzzing over the past couple of days with the story of a female university student who, over a period of five months, infected 586 men with HIV in “revenge.” The student, whose name has been withheld, claims to have infected married men, lecturers, fellow students and celebrities. According to the report, her aim was to infect 2,000 men with the virus. Her vengeance was met with horror and much criticism over social media.</p>\n<p>Her new goal is to infect at least 2,000 men stating, “I know I have nothing left to do on earth but wait for my death.” Surprisingly, she keeps a list of how many men she has slept with so far, and rewarded with HIV.

In the weeks leading up to the horrifying incident, Mouhib had <a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2018/04/06/sweden-mother-hanane-mouhib-charged-murder-son-abraham-cardenas/492426002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called 911</a> twice to complain about mental health issues, resulting in an 19-day stay at Rochester General Hospital. She had been released just ten days prior to the horrifying murder:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n[Monroe County Sheriff Todd] Baxter said that deputies had been called to the location twice [the previous] month when Mouhib had called 911 seeking assistance.</p>\n<p>On March 5 [2018], Baxter said it appeared that she recognized she was having mental health issues and called for help. Deputies took her to an area hospital.</p>\n<p>Three days later, she again called 911 telling dispatchers that she did not feel right. Because of the record of the March 5 encounter, Mouhib was taken to Rochester General Hospital, where she received treatment from March 8 to 26.</p>\n<p>There were no warning signs or indicators that preceded the fatal stabbing, Baxter said. What happened appeared to be “an isolated incident” inside the house, and there was no sign of a fight or altercation.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>No evidence has been released to the public identifying what Mouhib’s religious beliefs are, and the claim that she is Muslim appears to be based solely on the fact that she has an Arabic-sounding name. Furthermore, police investigating the murder said they have not found any indication that the killing was influenced by whatever Mouhib’s beliefs might be. </p>\n<p>When asked by a reporter during a press briefing whether Mouhib’s act “was any kind of maybe religious ritual,” Monroe County Sheriff Todd Baxter responded by saying that “No, someone else asked me that question. Absolutely zero indicators of anything religious, zero indicators of anything cultural … We have seen zero on that. There is really no indicators of that ‘why.'”</p>\n<p>Authorities have said they do not yet know what prompted Hanane Mouhib’s alleged attack on her son.  Mouhib pleaded not guilty to murder charges at her 6 April 2018 arraignment on second-degree murder charges and is currently being held without bail.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jihad-watch/\" target=\"_blank\">JihadWatch</a> is a generally unreliable source of information that has been “repeatedly criticized by numerous academics who believe that it promotes an Islamophobic worldview and conspiracy theories.”</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/bethania/\" class=\"author-link\">Bethania Palma</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/crime-scene-tape-building-blurred-forensic-429955534\" target=\"_blank\">Prath / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">6 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Frelie, Victoria E. and Sean Lahman.   “Sweden Mom Charged in Brutal Slaying of Her 7-Year-Old Son.”<br>\n    <em>Democrat &amp; Chronicle</em>.   6 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hernandez, Salvador.   “A Mom Allegedly Decapitated Her 7-Year-Old Son Just Days After She Was Released from a Hospital.”<br>\n    <em>BuzzFeed News</em>.   6 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Associated Press.   “Police: Mom Used Kitchen Knife to Decapitate 7-Year-Old Son.”<br>\n    <em>Star Tribune</em>.   6 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "121"},

The deadline for submissions is 13 April 2018.</p>\n<p>We reached out to DHS to ask if media reports suggesting this was an effort to compile political information on journalists were unfounded, as well as to ask for details about how this effort will enhance national security.

That claim appears to have originated with a National Review <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/08/election-fraud-registered-voters-outnumber-eligible-voters-462-counties/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> of 11 August 2017 that built on information compiled by Judicial Watch’s Election Integrity Project:</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<blockquote><p>Some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among America’s adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy is an engraved invitation to voter fraud.</p>\n<p>The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch — a Washington-based legal-watchdog group — analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011–2015 American Community Survey and last month’s statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states. According to Judicial Watch, eleven states gave the EAC insufficient or questionable information. Pennsylvania’s legitimate numbers place it just below the over-registration threshold.</p>\n<p>My tabulation of Judicial Watch’s state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties.</p>\n<p>These 462 counties (18.5 percent of the 2,500 studied) exhibit this ghost-voter problem. These range from 101 percent registration in Delaware’s New Castle County to New Mexico’s Harding County, where there are 62 percent more registered voters than living, breathing adult citizens — or a 162 percent registration rate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even if these numbers are assumed to be accurate, presenting them as definitively demonstrating that “some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among America’s adult citizens” is a questionable and problematic claim, given that the information was compiled from only 462 counties in 38 states, yet the entire U.S. comprises over 3,000 counties in fifty states. Many of those other counties might well have substantially fewer registered voters on their rolls than adult residents who are eligible to vote.</p>\n<p>Another major issue with such a claim is the potential inclusion of “inactive” voters among the tallies of registered voters, a matter that was publicized in a 1 August 2017 <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NVRA-letter-CA-August-2017-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a> Judicial Watch sent to California Secretary of State Alex Padilla threatening to sue unless the state and eleven of its counties produced voter records to them. According to Judicial Watch, their own analysis of U.S. Census data and voter registration records indicated those eleven counties included numbers of registered voters exceeding the numbers of adults eligible to vote in those counties.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, Judicial Watch <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JW-v-CA-NVRA-complaint-08948.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">made good</a> on their threat, initiating <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JW-v-CA-NVRA-complaint-08948.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">litigation</a> that is currently in progress in U.S. District Court, Central District of California. The lawsuit accuses California and multiple jurisdictions of violating the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) by failing to maintain updated voter registration rolls.</p>\n<p>Stories based on Judicial Watch’s letter initially made Internet waves in late summer 2017 via right-leaning <a href=\"https://archive.fo/z10nS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blogs</a> and Kremlin propaganda <a href=\"https://archive.fo/luU5w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">networks</a>. In April 2018, another version of the claim went viral in the form of an <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/u-s-has-3-5-million-more-registered-voters-than-live-adults-a-red-flag-for-electoral-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">editorial</a> published months ago by the financial publication <em>Investors Business Daily</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>California, for instance, has 11 counties with more registered voters than actual voters. Perhaps not surprisingly — it is deep-Blue State California, after all — 10 of those counties voted heavily for Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles County, whose more than 10 million people make it the nation’s most populous county, had 12% more registered voters than live ones, some 707,475 votes. That’s a huge number of possible votes in an election.</p>\n<p>But, Murdock notes, “California’s San Diego County earns the enchilada grande. Its 138% registration translates into 810,966 ghost voters.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many articles used that information to imply widespread voter fraud was taking place, an <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/three-million-votes-in-presidential-election-cast-by-illegal-aliens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unfounded</a> claim regularly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/802972944532209664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invoked</a> by President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>However, as <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article166187232.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multiple</a> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-judicial-watch-voter-registration-records-20170808-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">news organizations</a> have already <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-california-more-voters-than-eligible-adults-claim-20170809-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out</a>, the accusation of voter registration irregularities in California rests on the manner in which Judicial Watch counted California voters, combining active and inactive voters on a county-by-county basis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Judicial Watch’s claim rests on its inclusion of “inactive voters” – people who have been removed from active rolls after a mail ballot, voter guide or other official document was returned as undeliverable – usually as a result of moving. They aren’t reflected in turnout tallies or signature-gathering requirements, don’t receive election materials, and are ignored by campaigns.</p>\n<p>Inactive voters nevertheless underline Judicial Watch’s math suggesting that Los Angeles County has a registration rate of 112 percent, for example, or Stanislaus County has a registration rate of 102 percent. The letter cites a “failure to maintain accurate, up-to-date voter registration lists.”</p>\n<p>Bob Popper, director of Judicial Watch’s election integrity project, said California has failed to report its inactive voter data to the federal government as required by the National Voter Registration Act. Counties should be doing more to cull their inactive voter lists, he said.</p>\n<p>“What we identified is a red flag, a sign of smoke,” he said, saying people could be voting multiple times or in more than one state.</p>\n<p>In fact, California did report the data. Its inactive voter tally of 5,065,746 at the time of last fall’s election is part of the <a href=\"https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/2016_EAVS_Comprehensive_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most recent election administration and voting survey</a> published by the federal Election Assistance Commission.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The consideration of inactive voters is a key issue here. Judicial Watch maintains that registrations listed on state rolls as “inactive” are “vulnerable to abuse” by “voters who plan to fraudulently double-vote in two different jurisdictions on the same election day,” or by third parties “because a voter who has moved to a different state is unlikely to monitor the use of or communications concerning an old registration.”</p>\n<p>However, California’s National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) <a href=\"http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/nvra/laws-standards/nvra-manual/chapter-5/\" target=\"_blank\">regulations</a> state that although inactive voters remain on the rolls as registered voters who are eligible to vote, they do not receive “mailed election materials” (including mail-in ballots) and must “confirm residency at the polling place” in person in order to vote — standards that would severely limit or eliminate double-voting or the ability of third parties to fraudulently use inactive registrations to cast ballots:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Inactive voters” are defined as registered voters who have been sent a Section 8 notice and have failed to respond. In California, this includes voters for whom the post office has returned a [Voter Notification Card] because the voter has moved. What is important to keep in mind is that <strong>“inactive” voters under the California Elections Code and the NVRA are registered voters, eligible to vote in an election, provided the voter confirms residency at the polling place. Under California law, however, voters in the Inactive Voter File are not mailed election materials</strong>, and are not taken into consideration in determining the number of signatures required for qualification of candidates or ballot measures, precinct size, or other election administration processes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The California Secretary of State’s office confirmed to us directly that “the only way for inactive voters to obtain a ballot is for them to request a ballot in person at either a county elections office or at a polling location.”</p>\n<p>Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told us efforts such as the one undertaken by Judicial Watch and a similar one undertaken by another non-profit, the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), are not meant to strengthen election systems but rather to bully election officials into purging voter rolls, in contrast to both the spirit and letter of federal election laws.</p>\n<p>Often, she said, such figures produced by the likes of Judicial Watch and PILF fail to account for things such as active military members or students attending university away from their home jurisdictions that may affect figures and numbers in different ways:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s not just Judicial Watch. PILF <a href=\"https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/248-counties-registered-voters-live-adults/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used</a> these inaccurate figures to target 248 local jurisdictions levying the claim they have more registered voters on the roles <em>[sic]</em> than eligible people. Then we have the president who with great frequency repeats similar numbers.</p>\n<p>What we’re seeing is a campaign to create public hysteria about voter fraud. We know these figures are wrong and these efforts are aimed a voter suppression.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clarke added that U.S. census data is not a reliable measure of eligible voting population, and that<br>\ninactive voters can only be removed from rolls under specific circumstances, as noted in a <a href=\"https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Election-Official-NVRA-Memo-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memo</a> sent from her organization to the 248 jurisdictions targeted by PILF:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using an unreliable and inaccurate assessment of voter registration rates, PILF wrongly asserts that the jurisdictions it has targeted have more voters on the rolls than eligible residents. It then falsely claims these high registration rates alone provide strong evidence that a jurisdiction is not fulfilling its obligation to maintain accurate voter rolls.</p>\n<p>United States Census data, which PILF apparently relies on to estimate the eligible voting population, is neither designed to measure eligible voters nor does in fact do so. <strong>Population for Census purposes is not the same as eligible population for voting purposes. For example, students, service members and others are eligible to vote in jurisdictions where they currently live, even if the Census may count them as part of the population in other areas.</strong></p>\n<p>The figures PILF relies on to estimate registration rates fare no better. These reflect only the high-water mark rates at “book closing,” the period immediately before an election when there are typically large numbers of new registrants, and when election officials are restricted from removing people from the rolls.</p>\n<p>Even if a jurisdiction had more registered voters on its rolls than eligible population, there are many reasons why this might be proper and, indeed, evidence of compliance with the law. For example, when a registrant is thought to have changed residence, the law explicitly prohibits the removal of the voter’s name from the rolls unless either the voter has confirmed the change in writing or a sufficient waiting period has elapsed. A state complying with this requirement, then, will necessarily have ineligible voters on the rolls for a limited period of time. Likewise, in the three months prior to any federal election, states must halt most of their voter-removal efforts. At the same time, as the election approaches, new voters are registering in high numbers. This, too, will result in high registration rates when they are evaluated close to a federal election.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>PILF’s allegations of poor list maintenance in hundreds of jurisdictions around the country is baseless. Jurisdictions are not required under the NVRA or any other federal statute to take the actions PILF urges. Indeed, hasty and ill-considered list-maintenance programs are more likely to give rise to violations of the NVRA, and could put voters at risk of improper removal and, ultimately, disenfranchisement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When all of California (rather than eleven select counties) is taken into account, the figures offered in a 2 January 2018 <a href=\"http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/154day-stwddirprim-2018/historical-reg-stats.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> issued by the Secretary of State’s office list more than 25 million adults eligible to vote residing in California, but fewer than 19 million registered voters. The state would have to encompass more than <em>6 million</em> “ghost voters” on its rolls for the number of registered voters to exceed the number of eligible adults.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in the 2016 presidential election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won the state of California by more than <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/california/\" target=\"_blank\">3.4 million</a> votes over her closest competitor, Republican Donald Trump. Virtually every single one of the claimed 3.5 million “ghost voters” in the entire U.S. would have had to come to California and cast fraudulent votes in order to be responsible for that outcome.</p>\n<p>The trope that upwards of 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election is so persistent that it resulted in a now-defunct voter fraud commission, which was quietly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disbanded</a> in January 2018 without presenting any evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>10 April 2018: We modified the claim and rating sections of this page to better explicate multiple related but distinct aspects of the issue.</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/judicial-watch/\">judicial watch</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/public-interest-legal-foundation/\">Public Interest Legal Foundation</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/voter-fraud/\">voter fraud</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/voter-purge/\">voter purge</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/bethania/\" class=\"author-link\">Bethania Palma</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/vote-election-badge-button-2016-background-376847743\" target=\"_blank\">3dfoto / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">11 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Gomez, Luis.   “Fact Check: Do 11 California Counties Have More Voters Than Eligible Adults?”<br>\n    <em>San Diego Union-Tribune</em>.   10 August 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Myers, John.   “They Sued for Clinton’s Emails.

Instead of using it for academic purposes, as he claimed, Kogan passed it on to Cambrdige Analytica.</p>\n<p>Facebook learned about the transaction in 2015 and removed the app for violating platform policies, then suspended the accounts of those involved in the unraveling scandal in March 2018, once the breach became public knowledge and the company learned that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the information it had taken:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted.

So… We have something we would like to share. First off, it feels odd that we have to share this kind of thing with everyone, but it’s a consequence of the lives we’ve chosen to lead, which we also happen to be deeply grateful for. We’re living in an incredible moment in time, but it’s also a time where truth can easily get distorted into “alternative facts” ;) So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn’t read it here then it’s most certainly fiction.</p>\n<p>We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving, dedicated parents to Everly. We won’t be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family’s privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&amp;Jenna.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/29714476_1528894110552778_6785813118091001856_n.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135228\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/29714476_1528894110552778_6785813118091001856_n.jpg?resize=600,569\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/29714476_1528894110552778_6785813118091001856_n.jpg?w=1080 1080w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/29714476_1528894110552778_6785813118091001856_n.jpg?resize=300,284 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/29714476_1528894110552778_6785813118091001856_n.jpg?resize=768,728 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/29714476_1528894110552778_6785813118091001856_n.jpg?resize=1024,971 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The couple, who starred together in the 2006 movie <em>Step Up</em>, were <a href=\"http://people.com/celebrity/inside-channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan-s-malibu-wedding/\" target=\"_blank\">married</a> in 2009.

A July 2017 opinion piece in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> argued that the Postal Service effectively subsidizes Amazon’s shipping by setting its rates lower than the market will bear:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2007 the Postal Service and its regulator determined that, at a minimum, 5.5% of the agency’s fixed costs must be allocated to packages and similar products. A decade later, around 25% of its revenue comes from packages, but their share of fixed costs has not kept pace. First-class mail effectively subsidizes the national network, and the packages get a free ride. An April analysis from Citigroup estimates that if costs were fairly allocated, on average parcels would cost $1.46 more to deliver. It is as if every Amazon box comes with a dollar or two stapled to the packing slip — a gift card from Uncle Sam.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nor are the fiscal challenges faced by the USPS a brand new concern. In early 2017, the trade web site PostalTimes.com posted an <a href=\"https://www.postaltimes.com/postalnews/amazon-cant-save-usps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">editorial</a> observing that the Amazon.com partnership was initially seen as potentially beneficial to the “struggling” USPS, but turned to be otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in 2013 and 2014, the partnership between the USPS and Amazon.com made headlines as a potential saving grace for the struggling postal service. Amazon’s Prime membership rates were exploding — the primary benefit being free two-day shipping — and somebody needed to deliver these packages dependably and efficiently. The USPS was a natural ally due to its daily neighborhood canvassing, and the postal service even announced it would begin some Sunday deliveries for the first time in history — likely to please its new convenience-focused friend.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the partnership was not as mutually beneficial as once hoped. But that’s not for lack of trying.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, it’s one thing to point out that the partnership could have been more mutually beneficial and quite another to allege that its deal with Amazon.com is the main cause of the USPS’s financial woes. As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/postal-service-and-amazon-strike-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted</a> in 2013, legal constraints imposed on the Postal Service by Congressional fiat have hampered its profitability for years:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[USPS] faces myriad problems that have led to its financial decline. It faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into certain lines of business. It is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation.</p>\n<p>But an even bigger cause of the financial decline is a 2006 law that requires the Postal Service, unlike any other government agency, to pay $5.5 billion a year into a health fund for its future retirees. The majority of the agency’s losses since 2007, about $32 billion, result from the health funding requirement, financial documents show.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The USPS <a href=\"http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2017/pr17_069.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> a $2.7 billion net loss in 2017, marking its eleventh straight year of financial decline. It has averted bankruptcy only by defaulting on the mandate to prepay retiree health benefits, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. But the balance sheet also showed that although first-class and marketing mail revenues were down from the previous year, shipping and package delivery revenues were up. A significant portion of those gains were attributable to deals with companies like Amazon.com.</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/postal-service-may-get-freedom-raise-stamp-prices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by PBS NewsHour, the USPS routinely handles around 40 percent of Amazon’s “last mile” (distribution center to customer’s door) deliveries — almost the same volume as that handled by FedEx and UPS combined — thanks to its ability to offer lower rates based on existing mail routes and daily delivery schedules. </p>\n<p>Although the details of the agreement are proprietary, it’s safe to assume that no matter how competitive its rates, the Postal Service isn’t charging less than its own costs. That’s because federal law “requires the revenue for each competitive product to cover its attributable cost,” and the balance sheet is closely <a href=\"https://www.prc.gov/docs/104/104398/2017_ACD.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">monitored</a> by the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), an independent agency.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the PRC enforces strict price caps on so-called non-competitive products such as first-class mail — caps which, in the <a href=\"http://about.usps.com/news/statements/080117.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">words</a> of the USPS’s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, are “wholly unsuitable to ensuring the Postal Service’s continued ability to provide prompt and reliable universal services in a self-sufficient manner.” Postal Service officials have lobbied for greater latitude in adjusting prices to meet fiscal requirements.</p>\n<p>The USPS has been on a financially unsustainable path for years and could conceivably reach the point of requiring a government bailout unless lawmakers take action to revise the statutes governing its management, particularly with regard to issues such as funding retiree health benefits. However, the notion that this state of affairs stems from losses attributable to a sweetheart deal with Amazon.com strays far from the defensible fact. By law, the USPS is required, at minimum, to break even on the deal. </p>\n<p>And that puts the lie to Trump’s claim that the cost of the Postal Service’s alleged sweetheart deal with Amazon.com is ultimately “bourne [sic] by the American taxpayer.” The USPS doesn’t receive any tax dollars — but even if it did, since no money has been lost on the Amazon deal there are no such taxpayer costs to be “bourne.”</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/amazon/\">amazon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/donald-trump/\">donald trump</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/postal-service/\">postal service</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/usps/\">usps</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/washington-dc-usa-june-08-2017-656681785\" target=\"_blank\">Jeramey Lende / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">4 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nixon, Ron.   “Postal Service To Make Sunday Deliveries for Amazon.”<br>\n    <em>New York Times</em>.   11 November 2013.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>United States Postal Service Office Of The Inspector General</em>.   “Be Careful What You Assume.”<br>\n    16 February 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Postal Times</em>.   “Why Amazon Can’t Save the USPS.”<br>\n    26 April 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>H.R. 6407 (109th)</em>.   “Postal Accountability And Enhancement Act.”<br>\n    20 December 2006.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>USPS</em>.   “USPS CFO Responds To Wall Street Journal Article.”<br>\n    1 August 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>USPS</em>.   “U.S. Postal Service Reports Fiscal Year 2017 Results.”<br>\n    14 November 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Citi Research</em>.   “The Free Shipping Tax: Examining The Unsustainable Pricing Model Of The USPS.”<br>\n    18 April 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "9K"},

Because I don’t expect anything from anyone; expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be happy. And keep smiling.</p>\n<p>Just live for yourself and always remember:</p>\n<p>Before you speak… Listen<br>\nBefore you write… Think<br>\nBefore you spend… Earn<br>\nBefore you pray… Forgive<br>\nBefore you hurt… Feel<br>\nBefore you hate… Love<br>\nBefore you quit… Try<br>\nBefore you die… Live</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since Shakespeare lived long before the age of audio and video recording, one would expect a written record of all of his quotes, yet in the dozens of postings that we encountered attributing this quote to Shakespeare, not one pointed to an actual source. Furthermore, when we started digging into the actual phrases used in this passage, we found that some portions could be attributed to another author named William — just not Shakespeare. </p>\n<p>The portion of this quote, starting with “before you write” and ending with “before you die” appears to have been taken from a <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/221493-before-you-speak-listen-before-you-write-think-before-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poem</a> that was purportedly written by William Arthur Ward, an American author best known for his inspirational maxims. The one notable difference between the fake Shakespeare quote and the poem is that Ward (if it is indeed his poem) ended his text with a call to “give,” not “live”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Before you speak, listen.<br>\nBefore you write, think.<br>\nBefore you spend, earn.<br>\nBefore you invest, investigate.<br>\nBefore you criticize, wait.<br>\nBefore you pray, forgive.<br>\nBefore you quit, try.<br>\nBefore you retire, save.<br>\nBefore you die, give.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although Ward most likely wrote this poem (it is certainly more aligned with his style than with Shakespeare’s more florid prose) we have yet to uncover where it was first published. It was credited simply as a “Catholic quote” when it appeared in a Kansas newspaper in 1969:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/shakespeare.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135321\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/shakespeare.jpg?resize=600,1426\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/shakespeare.jpg?w=308 308w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/shakespeare.jpg?resize=126,300 126w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>A much longer version of this quote contains several other curious pieces of text. The closing line, for instance, states that a “strong person” should be able to hold back tears and smile:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Una persona fuerte sabe cómo mantener en orden su vida. Aún con lágrimas en los ojos, se las arregla para decir con una sonrisa “Estoy bien”.</p>\n<hr><p>A strong person knows how to keep his life in order. Even with tears in his eyes, he manages to say with a smile, “I’m fine”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s no evidence that Shakespeare wrote this, either. In fact, before this quote was attributed to him, it was part of a religious <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CarolynLovesLife/posts/177385508968994\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> chain message, and was shared with no attribution.</p>\n<p>We reached out to the Folger Shakespeare Library to find out more about this spurious quote and were told that there was no record of this passage in their archives. The Bard did, however, write that “life is short” at least once. From <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/1henryiv/1henryiv.5.2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Henry IV, Part 1:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>I cannot read them now.<br>\nO gentlemen, the time of life is short!<br>\nTo spend that shortness basely were too long,<br>\nIf life did ride upon a dial’s point,<br>\nStill ending at the arrival of an hour.<br>\nAn if we live, we live to tread on kings;<br>\nIf die, brave death, when princes die with us!<br>\nNow, for our consciences, the arms are fair,<br>\nWhen the intent of bearing them is just.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Shakespeare also touched on expectations in the play <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/allswell/allswell.2.1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>All’s Well That Ends Well</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Oft expectation fails and most oft there<br>\nWhere most it promises, and oft it hits<br>\nWhere hope is coldest and despair most fits.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This viral Shakespeare “quote,” then, is merely a pastiche of general platitudes. Although it may have touched on some of the general ideas that William Shakespeare wrote about, the included prose was certainly not written by the Bard himself.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources no-sources\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/berlin-germany-march-2017-shakespeare-wax-603985991\" target=\"_blank\">Yuri Turkov / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">5 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "286"},

On YouTube, of course, where people began uploading <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t75KXrmom9w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">videos</a> of themselves taking part in the so-called “condom snorting challenge” in 2013 (not to be confused with the not-nearly-as-gross “condom challenge,” which involved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuvkJQiSj6w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropping</a> water-filled condoms on other people’s heads).</p>\n<p>In answer to the several queries we’ve received: yes, the videos are real. We’ve watched them so you don’t have to.</p>\n<p>We hasten to add this caveat, however, that despite what you may have read in alarmist press coverage of the phenomenon in early 2018, it is not accurately described as a current “craze,” “fad,” or “trend.” The vast majority of condom snorting videos we found in a YouTube search were at least a year old. Most dated from 2013, with a few going all the way back to 2007.</p>\n<p>Mainstream news outlets <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Entertainment/condom-challenge-videos-youtube-bad-idea/story?id=18977460\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> on the condom snorting challenge in 2013, but the phenomenon was never that widespread and gradually petered out.</p>\n<p>March 2018 saw an uptick in media coverage, but it wasn’t because people were snorting condoms again. The more likely reason was publicity surrounding a phenomenon that had gone viral a few months earlier, the so-called “<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tide-pod-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tide pod challenge</a>,” which triggered safety warnings from poison control experts and led to a ban on videos of people eating laundry detergent.</p>\n<p>As with the Tide pod challenge, the press went into full-on moral panic mode in their coverage of condom snorting. Fox News was one of many news outlets <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2018/04/02/teens-snort-condoms-then-pull-them-through-mouths-in-disturbing-new-trend.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warning</a> that the “disturbing new trend” could be deadly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tide Pods are so January.</p>\n<p>Now teens are taking on an even grosser challenge in pursuit of Internet fame — and this one is making stomachs turn, as it is as disgusting as it is dangerous.</p>\n<p>The latest challenge involves snorting a condom up one nostril, inhaling, and finally pulling it from the throat out the mouth.</p>\n<p>Like other viral fads, this one has been around for years but is just now catching fire on social media, mostly via YouTube.</p>\n<p>Health authorities warn that the new “game” poses a real risk and can kill.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And, indeed, the unintended consequences can be fatal. Bruce Y. Lee, an associate professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, penned an <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/03/31/condom-snorting-challenge-why-you-should-not-inhale-condoms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> for <em>Forbes</em> citing examples of fairly serious injuries sustained by people who <em>accidentally</em> inhaled or ingested condoms during oral sex. In one case, a woman suffered a collapsed lung and contracted pneumonia after a condom went down her trachea. In another, a woman developed appendicitis after a condom fragment became lodged in her appendix.</p>\n<p>“While this does not necessarily mean that you should panic if you accidentally swallow a condom (because you may just eventually poop it out),” Lee wrote, “it does strongly suggest that you should not <em>deliberately</em> inhale or swallow a condom.”</p>\n<p>We concur. Let the record show that while we pooh-pooh the media’s claims that condom snorting rises to the level of a “trend,” we urge anyone tempted to try it to think hard about the possible consequences, which could, in fact, be dire.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/condom-snorting-challenge/\">condom snorting challenge</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/dares/\">dares</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/viral-challenges/\">viral challenges</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/viral-dares/\">viral dares</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-shot-various-colored-condoms-678938266\" target=\"_blank\">Purple Anvil / Shutterstock</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">2 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Alvarez, Alex.  “What Is the Condom Challenge and Why Are There Videos?”<br>\n  <em>ABC News</em>.  17 April 2013.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bowerman, Mary.  “The ‘Condom Snorting Challenge’ Is Every Parent’s Worst Nightmare.”<br>\n  <em>USA Today Network</em>.  2 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lee, Bruce Y.  “Condom Snorting Challenge: Why You Should Not Inhale Condoms.”<br>\n  <em>Forbes</em>.  31 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Liona, Carmen M.  “Teens Snort Condoms Then Pull Them Through Mouths in Disturbing New Trend.”<br>\n  <em>Fox News</em>.  2 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "30K"},

On Monday afternoon, Mobile Police Department spokesman Donald Wallace confirmed that they are investigating the incident.</p>\n<p>The KKK fliers, sent in clear ziploc bags, with a letter and white rice inside, appeared outside of homes in the Autumn Ridge neighborhood just before 4:00 p.m. on Saturday (June 17) afternoon. […] At this time the Mobile police said the investigation is ongoing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We reached out to the Mobile Police Department to confirm the details of these reports and to see if there had been any follow up in the time since it occurred. A summary of the case provided to us by the department confirms the incident, but suggests that the investigation concluded no crime had been committed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On June 17, 2017 police responded to the 6700 block of Harness Way for a suspicious call. Upon arrival, the complainant stated he found a Ziplock bag with rice and a flyer from the American Christian Knights KKK. Upon further investigation, officers observed several more of the flyers throughout the neighborhood including Autumn Ridge Apartments.</p>\n<p>No additional complaints were received after the initial report. The type of incident/offense remained suspicious circumstances. Distributing the flyer was not considered a crime, especially being that no threat/harm to others was made.</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/alabama/\">alabama</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/donald-trump/\">donald trump</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/kkk/\">KKK</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/ku-klux-klan/\">ku klux klan</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/alex/\" class=\"author-link\">Alex Kasprak</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">5 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Stokes, Prescotte III.   “KKK Fliers Praising President Donald Trump Surface in West Mobile.”<br>\n    <em>AL.com</em>.   19 June 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Appelbaum, Binyamin.   “Debt Concerns, Once a Core Republican Tenet, Take a Back Seat to Tax Cuts.”<br>\n    <em>New York Times</em>.   1 December 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Omar, Mohamed.   “KKK Flyers In Bags With Rice Spotted In B.C.”<br>\n    <em>Huffington Post</em>.   4 October 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Toler, William, R.   “KKK Recruiting in Richmond County?”<br>\n    <em>Richmond County Daily Journal</em>.   11 December 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lawson, Adam.   “KKK Fliers Delivered to Gaston County Driveways.”<br>\n    <em>Gaston Gazette</em>.   30 January 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ouriel, Andy.   “KKK Fliers Dispersed in Perkins.”<br>\n    <em>Sandusky Register</em>.   1 April 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "550"},

It wasn’t clear why the original article (published to a little-known web site) had been removed, but even that original walked its headline claim back a few lines into its text:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>All Facebook Users Could Cash in as much $17,500 Each After Data Breach</em></p>\n<p>If your data was harvested through Facebook you could get £12,500 compensation, according to an expert. The social network has come under fire after it was revealed Cambridge Analytica kept users’ data.</p>\n<p>This could cost Facebook £625 billion, which is double the £317b it is worth, law professor Maureen Mapp argued.</p>\n<p>‘There are about 50 million users whose data was harvested,’ she told the Sun.</p>\n<p><strong>‘Assuming each one of them brought a claim for compensation for distress caused by the data breach … each individual may be awarded £12,500 as damages … But a more likely outcome is that users would receive a maximum of £500 each, according to data protection lawyer David Barda, who works for Slater and Gordon.</strong></p>\n<p>He added: ‘The amount of compensation will depend on the level of distress suffered, but Facebook could be facing claims of up to £500 per Facebook user if those users were able to demonstrate their distress.’</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article appeared to have been sourced from an 2018 <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/28/uk-facebook-users-get-12500-data-breach-7424789/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> published by the UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>. But that highly speculative <em>Sun</em> article pertained solely to users in the UK who might be entitled to damages under a law (Data Protection Act 1998) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">specific</a> to the UK and not applicable in the United States or elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In order to get the cash users would have to prove they had suffered distress as a result of the data breach and it would fall under the Data Protection Act. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has apologised for the way user data was handled. Cambridge Analytica is currently being investigated UK Information Commissioner’s Office.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In short, the notion that Facebook users could collect money from the social network over the Cambridge Analytica controversy was a highly speculative one that was specific to UK users only and posited £12,500 (US $17,500) as a theoretical maximum rather than a likely payment.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/kiev-ukraine-june-13-2016-facebook-443533831\" target=\"_blank\">rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">6 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nsubuga, Jimmy.   “UK Facebook Users ‘Could Get £12,500 Each After Data Breach.”<br>\n    <em>Metro.co.uk</em>.   28 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>FB News Post</em>.   “All Facebook Users Could Cash In As Much $17,500 Each After Data Breach.”<br>\n    5 April 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Wikipedia</em>.   “Data Protection Act 1998.”<br>\n    Accessed 6 April 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "650"},

Two days before his arrest, Glasgow, a community activist, pastor, and reportedly the half-brother of civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton, had participated in a local “March for Our Lives” protest as part of a nationwide movement against gun violence.</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>The story went viral, perhaps due to the juxtaposition of Glasgow’s participation in the anti-gun violence rally combined with the fact he is reportedly related to Sharpton. An inaccurate post on Facebook that also spread far and wide claimed, “Al Sharpton’s half brother, an anti gun activist, shoots a person in the head, killing them instantly yesterday. CNN silent.”</p>\n<p>As is often the case, reality is more nuanced than a clickbait headline can convey. Glasgow and his organization, The Ordinary People Society (TOPS), participated in the March for Our Lives rally on 24 March 2018 in Alabama’s Wiregrass region; Glasgow was not an organizer, but he did make an impromptu speech. March for Our Lives Wiregrass organizer Kailee Maciulla told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>He did speak on stage but was not scheduled to — our speakers were Tabitha Isner, Audri Scott Williams and Ambrosia Starling along with several students. So while he wasn’t scheduled to speak he did in fact come on stage unscheduled and unplanned. He had nothing to do with organizing the march — that was me and several other community members including students. […] As a member of the community whose family has been the victim of gun violence myself… this crime and whatever Glasglow’s participation was is absolutely heartbreaking for me as it pertains to the victim, Breunia Jennings and her family.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The night after the march, police were <a href=\"https://www.dothanpd.org/2018/03/26/two-dothan-men-arrested-for-capital-murder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> to the scene of a homicide at about 10:50 P.M., where they found Breunia Jennings, 23, shot to death. Jamie Emmanuel Townes, 26, was arrested and charged with capital murder. As the local newspaper the <em>Dothan Eagle </em><a href=\"http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/crime_court/kenneth-glasgow-s-capital-murder-charge-based-on-alabama-s/article_38b2bdb2-3143-11e8-8e16-c7121591ae58.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>, Glasgow is not accused of shooting Jennings; Townes allegedly asked Glasgow to drive him around and look for his stolen car. Townes allegedly opened fire on Jennings because he believed she was the car thief — a claim Jennings mother says is <a href=\"http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/crime_court/mother-of-breunia-jennings-they-didn-t-have-to-kill/article_803021c4-3202-11e8-acca-0750404676db.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not true</a>.</p>\n<p>Glasgow was charged with capital murder due to an Alabama law which holds that a person is legally accountable for a crime committed by another, <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2006/13297/13a-2-23.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">if</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>(1) he procures, induces, or causes such other person to commit the offense; or (2) he aids or abets such other person in committing the offense; or (3) having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, he fails to make an effort he is legally required to make.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/crime_court/kenneth-glasgow-makes-first-appearance-in-court-questions-capital-murder/article_5333af6e-31d6-11e8-9a73-0ffeccb95519.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Eagle</em></a>, which sent a reporter to Glasgow’s first court hearing on 27 March 2018, Glasgow questioned why he was being charged with the same crime as Townes, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t know why I am facing capital murder charges. I’m not responsible for what someone else does.

However, the claims made in recent Facebook posts about it are false: This picture was not taken in March 2018, and the animal it captured traces of (if any)  did not destroy a trail camera or kill an Alabama farmer’s livestock.</p>\n<p>This image has been online since at least as far back as October 2015, when it was shared on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/8bbIB_BtRK/?taken-by=o6lr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> along with a story about a sailor in Oman who was “shocked” to find the image on his camera. This photograph has also been used to illustrate similar stories about a strange creature that was supposedly found in <a href=\"https://www.muchata.com/viral-fake-photos-on-aliens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">India</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/saojosealerta/posts/1585275024834098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brazil</a>, and <a href=\"http://hmongbuy.net/video/74YnS3wzAZg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hawaii</a>. Needless to say, we’re skeptical that this exact same photograph was pulled from cameras in so many different locations and times.</p>\n<p>So what does this picture actually show? While this image is frequently claimed to depict evidence of a lobisomem, South America’s version of a werewolf, we’re fairly certain that this is a dog (or another extant species) suffering from <a href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/skin/c_multi_Demodicosis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mange</a>: “Mange (demodicosis) is an inflammatory disease in dogs caused by various types of the Demodex mite.

(None of these stories about him are true.) </p>\n<p>At the end of March, conspiracy theorists started another spurious rumor about Hogg, this time claiming that the gun control activists had ignored combat veterans who fought in previous wars when he allegedly said that “generations before us don’t know what it’s like to be shot at by AR-15s”:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/david-hogg-fake-quote.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135038\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/david-hogg-fake-quote.jpg?resize=600,782\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/david-hogg-fake-quote.jpg?w=651 651w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/04/david-hogg-fake-quote.jpg?resize=230,300 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>One common attack tactic directed at surviving Parkland students arguing for gun control seems to be that the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/laura-ingraham-david-hogg-florida-shooting-survivor-ox-news-bully-gun-laws-a8285021.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teenaged</a> activists do not know enough about guns, gun control, or the world in general to be a credible voice in that debate. This meme plays on that theme as it insinuates that Hogg is ignorant of America’s history in war.

The woman’s 12-year old daughter was also present.</p>\n<p>“Deputies arrived at the scene and insured the safety of the victims who had locked themselves inside a room because they weren’t sure if the intruder was still inside the home,” Early County Investigator Captain Will Caudill said.</p>\n<p>Officers also discovered 53-year old Michael Lindsey outside the home. He was taken to a Blakely hospital and pronounced dead. He’s believed to have stumbled from inside before collapsing.</p>\n<p>Prior to the shooting she fought off her attacker with a spoon, a police report states.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, Neon Nettle is a notorious fake news blog with a predilection for publishing sensationalized (if not completely fabricated) stories about <a href=\"http://www.neonnettle.com/tags/pedophile\" target=\"_blank\">pedophiles</a>, and true to form, Neon Nettle added multiple false elements to this particular report to enhance its luridness.</p>\n<p>For example, as we confirmed with Early County Investigator Captain <a href=\"http://earlycountysheriff.com/investigations.html\" target=\"_blank\">Will Caudill</a>, the woman referenced in this report did not “blow [the intruder’s] off with a shotgun.” The weapon she used was a handgun, and the intruder, Michael Lindsey, had “no gunshot wounds above the torso of his body.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the mother did not find Lindsey “trying to rape her 12-year-old child.” Lindsey had concealed himself in a closet of the home for reasons that remain indeterminate, as Captain Caudill told us that investigators “did not factually determine the motive for the burglary.” Finally, although Lindsey was a sex offender, he would likely not be described by any responsible news account as a “notorious pedophile,” given that he had but a single related conviction on his record, and that was from nearly twenty years earlier (1999).</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/\" class=\"author-link\">David Mikkelson</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">3 April 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Greenberg, Jay.   “Mom Catches Pedophile Trying to Rape Child, Blows His Head Off with Shotgun.”<br>\n    <em>Neon Nettle</em>.   11 February 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Curtis, Ken.   “Convicted Sex Offender Shot by Woman After Breaking Into Home.”<br>\n    <em>WTVY-TV</em>.   6 February 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "111"},

Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). In the message, Earhardt appeared to suggest the permit for the 24 March 2018 rally had been submitted well before the 14 February 2018 school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in which seventeen people were murdered, saying that “In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018.

However, Earhardt told non-partisan fact checker <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/03/fellowship-minds/no-march-our-lives-demonstration-was-not-prepared-/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PolitiFact</a> that he had confused the “March for Our Lives” rally with an annual event in January bearing a similar name: <a href=\"https://marchforlife.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">March for Life</a>.</p>\n<p>MPD spokeswoman Karimah Bilal told us that the permit application for the March for Our Lives rally was received on 21 February 2018, one week after the massacre. We obtained a copy of the march permit application via a Freedom of Information Act request and confirmed that it was submitted on 21 February 2018, one week after the massacre. The document can be viewed below.</p>\n<p>A pervasive, but consistently unfounded trope among conspiracy theorists and “<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/03/07/conspiracy-theorists-arrested-released/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hoaxers</a>” is that any mass casualty incident, particularly mass shootings, are “false flags,” or events engineered by the government in a widespread plot to install an authoritarian global government (often referred to as the “<a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/New_World_Order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New World Order</a>“).

Corey says he got off the freeway and soon noticed a car was following him — a car that looked like the one with the erratic driver on the freeway.</p>\n<p>He says his security guard had words with someone in the other car and, when Corey was stopped at a red light, the passengers in the other car made their move. Corey says one of the guys pulled his door open and jabbed him one time with a sharp object — either the tip of a knife or a syringe.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a video published by TMZ, Feldman elaborated on his assertion that the assault was related to his pedophilia claims:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One thing I can tell you for sure is that I do know 100% for a fact that there is a conspiracy. I do know for a fact that that conspiracy has to do with every false accusation that you’ve heard about me in the media within the last six months. And I do know who the organizer of that conspiracy is. And I do know who it’s being lead by — and I do know why. It all has to do with the pedophilia claims that I’ve made … I can’t say that this incident was related, but what I can say is that it’s very odd that a group of Mexican guys would pull over a car, go as far as opening a door and stabbing the person inside. Because generally, if they’re going to do that kind of an aggressive move, they’re going to ask for a wallet at that point, they’re going to ask for your car keys, they’re going to ask for some kind of demand. Because they’ve got you there. The guy just got back in his car and left. So that sounds pretty direct to me. That sounds like a message.</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe style=\"width: 728px; height: 410px;\" data-src=\"//cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/591531/sp/59153100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/6740162/partner_id/591531?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1413478522&amp;entry_id=0_jaxv5ikd\" width=\"664\" height=\"421\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><noscript><iframe style=\"width: 728px; height: 410px;\" src=\"//cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/591531/sp/59153100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/6740162/partner_id/591531?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1413478522&amp;entry_id=0_jaxv5ikd\" width=\"664\" height=\"421\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></noscript></center>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A representative of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) provided conflicting <a href=\"http://ktla.com/2018/03/28/actor-corey-feldman-says-he-was-stabbed-in-car-lapd-investigating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">information</a> to Los Angeles television station KTLA, stating that an unidentified person had merely gesticulated at Feldman while his car was stopped at a traffic light, and that no wound had resulted from the incident:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Officer Drake Madison said Feldman, who was behind the wheel, and a passenger were at a stoplight when an unknown person approached the driver’s window, made a “jabbing motion” and fled.

He went on to describe south Brooklyn in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy (when the borough actually underwent a <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nra-boss-defames-brooklyn-sandy-screed-article-1.1264387\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lull</a> in violent crime) as a “hellish world” where “looters ran wild” and anyone who failed to get home before dark “might not get home at all.”</p>\n<p>Some NRA supporters have countered accusations that the group has been racially insensitive by claiming the opposite is true — that the organization was, in fact, founded in order to combat racist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and ensure that African Americans, particularly freed slaves, could defend themselves against racist attacks:</p>\n<p></p><center><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Pasted-image-at-2018_03_29-02_50-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-134610\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Pasted-image-at-2018_03_29-02_50-PM.png?w=600\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Pasted-image-at-2018_03_29-02_50-PM.png?w=500 500w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Pasted-image-at-2018_03_29-02_50-PM.png?resize=197,300 197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></center><br>\nOne version of this revisionist narrative was laid out by conservative Christian author David Barton during a 2013 <a href=\"https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=27a_1358526659\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appearance</a> on Glenn Beck’s television show, <em>The Blaze</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/01/16/nrthings-you-never-knew-about-the-second-amendment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">summarized</a> on Beck’s web site as follows:\n<blockquote><p>… In addition, Barton addressed the founding of the NRA. While some like to demonize pro-Second Amendment group and even call it  prejudiced, it turns out the powerful group was in fact started by two Union generals in 1871 as a means to driving out the Ku Klux Klan and ensuring that blacks, who although then-free were not allowed means with which to defend themselves — could in fact legally own a gun.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Barton’s statement echoed one made by Harry Alford, the president and chief executive officer of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, who had praised the National Rifle Association during a February 2013 <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?311127-1/news-conference-gun-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press conference</a> on gun control:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to thank the Lord for our Constitution. I also want to thank the NRA for its legacy. The National Rifle Association was started, founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan. They would raise money, buy arms, show the free slaves how to use those arms and protect their families. God bless you. Many of us probably wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for the NRA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The same claim has turned up in the form of social media memes emphasizing the NRA’s purported role in training black Americans to fight back against the Ku Klux Klan:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/nra-kkk-meme.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-134408\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/nra-kkk-meme.jpg?resize=600,600\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/nra-kkk-meme.jpg?w=600 600w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/nra-kkk-meme.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/nra-kkk-meme.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>These sources fall short when it comes to providing evidence to support their claims, however. Indeed, the notion that the National Rifle Association originated as a group devoted to protecting freed slaves and “driving out” the Ku Klux Klan contradicts the NRA’s own <a href=\"https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">account</a> of its origin (as posted on their web site):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to “promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,” according to a magazine editorial written by Church.</p>\n<p>After being granted a charter by the state of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. senator, became the fledgling NRA’s first president.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to NRA co-founder George Wingate’s own <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/historytwentyse00winggoog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">account</a> in his 1896 <em>History of the Twenty-Second Regiment of the National Guard of the State of New York</em>, the organization was founded to fulfill a perceived need to provide marksmanship training for members of the armed forces, prompting his authorship of a rifle training manual and participation in the creation of the National Rifle Association:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The instructions which had thus been prepared by the writer were afterwards elaborated by him in a series of articles published in the Army and Navy Journal during 1869 and 1870, which excited much discussion in military circles. They led to the formation of the National Rifle Association in September 1871, of which their author was made secretary, and afterwards vice-president and president. These regulations constituted the foundation of <em>Wingate’s Manual of Rifle Practice</em>, which was written at the request of the National Rifle Association to supply a book which would serve as a manual of instruction for the National Guard.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The NRA’s mission statement, as published in the organization’s 1873 <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=_KxLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Annual Report</a>, tells the same story in greater detail:</p>\n<blockquote><p>REASONS FOR ITS ORGANIZATION</p>\n<p>Although the introduction of the rifle as a military weapon was owing to the lessons of our Revolution, and although our success in the earlier contests of our history depended upon the skill in its use displayed by our ancestors, no recognition has been given by our citizens of the fact that the change which has taken place in the habits of the American people is rapidly depriving them of that personal skill in arms and marksmanship which has hitherto formed one of the greatest elements of our national strength. This is the more to be regretted, as the introduction of long range breech loaders has made this skill of even more importance at the present time; than under the ancient system for not only the conflict between Prussia and Austria, but the more recent French and Prussian contest have demonstrated that the very accuracy and rapidity of fire, which renders these arms so formidable in the hands of trained marksmen, simply results in a waste of ammunition with those unfamiliar with their use, which leaves an army helpless at the decisive moment of battle. Other nations, recognizing these facts, have long since instituted a thorough system of instruction in rifle practice, France, Germany, Switzerland, and above all, England, and Canada unite in giving to rifle practice a leading position in their systems of military training.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>In this country, on the other hand, the matter has been entirely neglected, although our entire system of defense is based upon the levying of volunteers in cases of emergency, who, to be valuable or even available, must understand the use of arms and supply by their skill as individuals the confidence which discipline gives to regular troops. While England has a system of rifle practice which is required to be annually and thoroughly performed by every soldier in her army whether stationed in India, Australia, or Europe, our War Department has not even enforced the system of Major Willard, adopted in 1862, and sends raw recruits against the Indian hunters of the plains. In the National Guard of New York, and other States, a similar apathy has prevailed so that it has been the rule, not the exception, for a man to serve out his full term of enlistment in their ranks without firing a shot.</p>\n<p>FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION</p>\n<p>This anomalous condition of affairs, having excited considerable discussion among military men through the press, finally on November 24 1871 led to the formation in the City of New York of The National Rifle Association, which was designed and bids fair to be the parent of many similar associations throughout the country.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We found similar accounts in any number of books on the history of firearms and gun politics in the United States, including <em>Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law</em> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Guns-American-Society-Encyclopedia-Politics/dp/0313386706\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2012</a>), <em>Gun Violence in America: The Struggle for Control</em> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gun-Violence-America-Struggle-Control/dp/1555534864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2003</a>), and <em>Gun Politics in America</em> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gun-Politics-America-Historical-Documents-ebook/dp/B01FR7IQ92\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016</a>). All of them cited the need for organized firearms training in the military as the primary motivation for the NRA’s creation; none of them mentioned protecting freed slaves or doing battle against the Ku Klux Klan.</p>\n<p>While it is not impossible that some black Americans were indirect beneficiaries of the NRA’s firearms training evangelism after the Civil War, we rate these revisionist notions about the group’s founding purpose False.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>29 March 2018, 2:56 P.M.: Added meme; swapped out featured image.</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/guns/\">guns</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/kkk/\">KKK</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/ku-klux-klan/\">ku klux klan</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+4 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/national-rifle-association/\">national rifle association</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/nra/\">nra</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/racism/\">racism</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/slavery/\">slavery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">28 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">29 March 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Carter, Gregg Lee.  <em>Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law</em>.<br>\n  New York: ABC-CLIO, 2012.  ISBN 9780313386701.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cooke, Charles C.W.  “Do Black People Have Equal Gun Rights?”<br>\n  <em>The New York Times</em>.  25 October 2014.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>DeConde, Alexander.  <em>Gun Violence in America: The Struggle for Control</em>.<br>\n  Lebanon, New Hampshire: UPNE, 2003.  ISBN 9781555535926.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Gabbay, Tiffany.  “Do You Know the History of the NRA and the 2nd Amendment?

In this case, the scary new drug was “bug spray” (referring generally to insecticide products such as <i>Raid</i>, which contain <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/pyrethrins-and-pyrethroids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pyrethroid</a> compounds), with the Daily Mail reporting that “US health officials have seen a surge in the number of people using bug spray to get high. In the last year the alarming trend has been reported in Mississippi, Tennessee and most recently Indiana.”</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>Here, the <i>Daily Mail</i> was attempting to tie three separate incidents, speculatively and sometimes inaccurately reported on by local news outlets, into a single, surging trend. The <i>Mail</i> was able to do by capitalizing on the flaws and ambiguities inherent in the original local news reports — a prime example of the local news-<i>Daily Mail</i> misinformation complex.</p>\n<p>In reality, no evidence establishes such an “alarming trend,” because only one of the three incidents cited by the <em>Daily Mail</em> involved a confirmed case of a person using an insecticide intentionally as a form of recreational drug. The remaining two reports were based on conjecture and hearsay that either referenced the same incident or were too different to be considered part of the same alleged trend (and were also just as speculative).</p>\n<p>In July 2017, the Monroe County Sheriff’s Department in Mississippi reported that a person had combined methamphetamine with crystals produced from spraying Raid “Hot Shots” on an electrified screen, and then injected that material into his veins. Both <a href=\"http://archive.is/g4E7n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local media</a> reports and the <i>Daily Mail</i> used vague language to make it sound as if the situation in Mississippi were part of an increasingly common occurrence, but Chief Deputy Curtis Knight told us that the occurrence was an isolated case: “The incident where an individual was arrested at our facility for allegedly injecting ‘Hot Shot’ bug spray has been an isolated incident. The user and a witness to the use both stated, ‘Hot Shot’ bug spray was sprayed on a screen and electricity applied to crystalize the bug spray then mixed with methamphetamine and injected.”</p>\n<p>The second “bug-spray” related incident allegedly took place in Tennessee, and it is a memorable <a href=\"http://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Police-Naked-man-in-tree-was-high-on-wasp-spray-dope-468096993.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tale</a> involving a man allegedly high on a mix of “wasp spray” and methamphetamine breaking into a random family’s home and drinking water from their sink before cutting himself with a knife, jumping out of the house’s second floor window, and throwing feces at police from a nearby tree. While some second-hand news reports suggested the perpetrator admitted to intentionally using this combination of drugs, more detailed reporting held that this suggestion was just an assmuption based on an interpretation of drug trends greatly mirroring the description of the earlier Mississippi event:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s likely possible because of a dangerous new drug known as ‘Wasp Spray Dope.’ Officials in Lawrence County said drug dealers are crystallizing wasp spray, then mixing them with meth. “It’s fairly new but it seems to be spreading, rapidly,” said Zach Ferguson, an investigator with the Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Lawrence County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to multiple requests for clarification via e-mail, phone, and voicemail, but news reports and a lack of readily available forensic tests for wasp spray imply no confirmation was made that “wasp spray” was found in the perpetrator’s system, or that he knowingly consumed the substance or admitted to intentionally using it, as insinuated by most accounts reporting on this alleged trend. It bears mentioning that a number of drugs, including methamphetamine on its own, can produce <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-meth-fights-cops-masturbating-police-article-1.1557876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similarly</a> bizarre or violent reactions in users.</p>\n<p>The final and most recent in the list of incidents pointing to this “alarming trend” potentially involved no bug spray at all. The event itself, a series of overdoses at an Indianapolis men’s shelter named Wheeler Mission, occurred in January 2018 and as <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2018/02/01/wheeler-mission-says-least-17-guests-have-overdosed-bath-salts-week/1088153001/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> at the time involved no mention of “bug spray”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over the last two days, 27 people have overdosed on suspected bath salts in or around Wheeler Mission, including 17 who were guests at the downtown men’s shelter.</p>\n<p>Steve Kerr, Wheeler’s chief development officer, said seven men overdosed inside the building, while another 10 overdosed directly outside the building. All are suspected to have taken <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/synthetic-cathinones-bath-salts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bath salts</a> that may have been laced with another drug, he said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a follow up <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2018/03/18/think-what-its-doing-your-brain-using-bug-spray-get-high/426668002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by <i>IndyStar</i> (published a day before the <i>Daily Mail </i>story ran), investigators later concluded that the cause of the overdose was <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/synthetic-cannabinoids-k2spice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spice</a> (a name for a synthetic form of cannabis) mixed with some “unknown chemical”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At least 17 guests were believed to have overdosed on “Katie” [or KD] — another mix of spice and an unknown chemical or drug. Most of the men were able to bounce back, but at least one was taken to the hospital and placed on a ventilator that week, according to mission leadership.</p>\n<p>Indianapolis police said a subsequent investigation led them to several drug houses connected to the distribution of spice mixed with an unknown chemical. Officers made six arrests in connection with the overdoses and confiscated nearly 10 pounds of synthetic marijuana and five handguns.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The assertion that the additional chemical was some form of bug spray, and not merely another one of the hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-synthetic-marijuana-and-why-is-it-dangerous\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largely unknown</a> chemicals being sold as synthetic marijuana, came from an emergency responder with the Indianapolis Fire Department who was quoted in that same March story: “Indianapolis firefighter Scott Lebherz told IndyStar this variation of KD can take many forms — marijuana, spice, tobacco, even banana leaves — but shares a common trait: all laced with a heavy-duty household bug spray.”</p>\n<p>We reached out to the Indianapolis Fire Department to ask how they reached the conclusion that the adulterating chemical in these cases was some form of insecticide. An official there told us via e-mail that this was based on stories heard in the field, not from testing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We do not test for Wasp Spray. We have on scene stories told to us — of people spraying their drugs with this and similar products to either enhance the high or confuse drug sniffing dogs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <i>Indiana Star,</i> the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and numerous other outlets quoted Daniel Rusyniak, the Medical Director of the Indiana Poison Center, to describe the theoretical effects of using pyrethroid as a recreational drug. What is sometimes left out in these reports, however, is his skepticism that pyrethroids would produce the symptoms attributed to them, or that they would be able to cause any enhancement to a high whatsoever. Over the phone, he told us that pyrethroids can cause <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00139709-200524020-00003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">problems</a> in humans, but only “at concentrations that are probably not going to be achieved unless somebody’s got some good chemistry skills,” adding that “There are a few case reports of people getting [central nervous system] excitation and some seizures and coma, but most people tolerate fairly large amounts of this without a lot of medical complications.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, the medical literature includes numerous stories of people consuming or even injecting large volumes of pyrethroids and being generally fine without any detour into violent, psychotic, or zombie-like behavior. A 2005 <a href=\"http://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(05)00062-8/pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">case report</a>, for example, described a 36-year old man who attempted to kill himself by injecting himself with 6 mL of pyrethroid-containing insecticides:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A 36-year-old man injected 6 mL of Real Kill Ant and Roach Killer 2 into his antecubital fossa and 2 mL subcutaneously into his abdomen in a suicide attempt. Upon evaluation in the emergency department, 1 hour later, he had pain at the injection site and no other symptoms … He was admitted to inpatient psychiatry and remained clinically well throughout his 3-day course.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Speaking specifically of the Indiana incident, Rusyniak — who actually treated some of the people involved in the January 2018 Wheeler Mission overdose incident — told us that the symptoms described were not a unique occurrence, and could be explained by as a result of synthetic cannabis and similar chemicals: “I saw some of the people at the Wheeler Mission, and took care of some of them. [Their symptoms were] indistinguishable from a lot of outbreaks that we’ve seen [that involved only] synthetic cannabinoids.”</p>\n<p>“The idea that this is somehow unique or different from the clinical effects of the synthetic cannabinoids alone [has not been demonstrated], at least so far,” Rusyniak said. The Indiana incident, is, however, distinct from the previous events alleged to be part of the trend in that the primary drug was synthetic marijuana, not methamphetamine.</p>\n<p>There are two cases, though only one has been confirmed, in which a crystallized form of bug spray is alleged to have been added to methamphetamine, and these events resulted in symptoms <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-meth-fights-cops-masturbating-police-article-1.1557876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consistent</a> with an aggressive methamphetamine high. The final case, in contrast, involved the unconfirmed assertion that bug spray, in liquid form, was sprayed to synthetic marijuana (to enhance the high or perhaps throw drug dogs off the scent) and resulted in symptoms <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/nyregion/zombielike-state-was-caused-by-synthetic-marijuana.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consistent</a> with a synthetic marijuana overdose. The collection of these three events does not coherently create a narrative that can be considered an “alarming trend,” but because at least one credible report documents a case in which someone intentionally injected Raid (mixed with methamphetamine), we rank the assertion of a surge in the number of people using “bug spray” to get high as mostly false.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/bug-spray/\">bug spray</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/daily-mail/\">daily mail</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/drug-trends/\">drug trends</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/methamphetamines/\">methamphetamines</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/spice/\">spice</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/alex/\" class=\"author-link\">Alex Kasprak</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fairfax-va-december-5-load-bug-168821852\" target=\"_blank\">Huguette Roe / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">29 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sheets, Megan.   “Huge Surge in People Getting High on Bug Spray Which Leaves Them ‘Raging Like a Mad Dog’, Health Officials Warn.”<br>\n    <em>Daily Mail</em>.   19 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Environmental Protection Agency</em>.   “Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids.”<br>\n    Accessed 28 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bounds, Jared.   “Terrifying New Drug Trend in NE Mississippi Involves Shooting Up Wasp Spray.”<br>\n    <em>NewsMS.fm</em>.   28 July 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Conte, Chris.   “Police: Naked Man in Tree Was High on ‘Wasp Spray Dope.’”<br>\n    <em>WVLT-TV</em>.   4 January 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Landau, Joel.   “Oregon Man on Meth Fights Off Cops While Masturbating in Bar: Police.”<br>\n    <em>[New York] Daily News</em>.   24 December 2013.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hays, Holly V.   “Wheeler Mission Says at Least 17 Guests Have Overdosed on Bath Salts This Week.”<br>\n    <em>IndyStar</em>.   1 February 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>National Institute on Drug Abuse</em>.   “Synthetic Cathinones (‘Bath Salts’)”<br>\n    Accessed 28 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>National Institute on Drug Abuse</em>.   “Synthetic Cannabinoids (K2/Spice)”<br>\n    Accessed 28 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rahn, Bailey.   “What Is “Synthetic Marijuana” and How is It Made?”<br>\n    <em>Leafly</em>.   4 December 2014.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bradberry, Sally M. et al.   “Poisoning Due to Pyrethroids”<br>\n    <em>Toxicological Reviews</em>.   July 2005.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>LoVecchio, Frank, and Jason Knight.   “Injection of Pyrethroids Without Significant Sequelae.”<br>\n    <em>American Journal of Emergency Medicine</em>.   May 2005.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Santora, Marc.   “Drug 85 Times as Potent as Marijuana Caused a ‘Zombielike’ State in Brooklyn.”<br>\n    <em>The New York Times</em>.   14 December 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "356"},

They added that the proposals were not rejected because vaccinations would be “harmful,” but because “all health care in Sweden, including vaccination programs, is voluntary.”</p>\n<p>Conspiracy theory blogs also reported that the Riksdagen “banned” mandatory vaccinations. What it did not mention is that the country’s voluntary vaccination program, which <a href=\"https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/vaccinations/vaccination-programmes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">covers</a> ten diseases, already dates back <a href=\"https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/vaccinations/previous-swedish-vaccination-programmes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decades.</a></p>\n<p>While Sweden’s program is voluntary, the vast majority of children are still vaccinated; the Folkhalsomyndigheten spokesperson told us, “More than 97 percent of the 2 year olds have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, for example.” Overall, however, the country experienced an increase in measles cases in 2017. The European Centers for Disease Control <a href=\"https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/Bi-annual%20measles%20rubella%20monitoring-OCT-2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that Sweden was one of 18 nations where the number of cases reported during the first half of 2017 exceeded that of the same period a year earlier.</p>\n<p>YourNewsWire.com and similar blogs sourced their stories from a report from an “alternative health” group, the National Health Federation. However, this group has come under its share of scrutiny and criticism. For example, the American Cancer Society excoriated the group in a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3322/canjclin.41.1.61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> concerning “unproven methods” of managing the disease, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After study of the literature and other available information, the American Cancer Society has found no evidence that methods of treatment promoted by the National Health Federation (NHF) result in objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings. Lacking such evidence, the American Cancer Society strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment based on the recommendations of the NHF.</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/age-of-autism/\">Age of Autism</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/anti-vaccine/\">anti-vaccine</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/antivaxxer/\">antivaxxer</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+4 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/red-ice/\">Red Ice</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/sweden/\">sweden</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/vaccinations/\">vaccinations</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/yournewswire/\">yournewswire</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/doctor-scientist-laboratory-holding-syringe-liquid-578350774\" target=\"_blank\">HQuality/Shutterstock</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Public Health Agency of Sweden.</em> “Previous Swedish Vaccination Programmes.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>European Centers for Disease Control.</em> “Bi-annual measles and rubella monitoring report.”<br>\n    October 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>American Cancer Society.</em> “Unproven methods of cancer management.

The new memorial will make good on President Trump’s promise to bring about a peaceful resolution to the nearly 20-year contrived conflict.</p>\n<p>“President Trump is proud to declare victory in the War on Christmas,” said a White House spokesman, who repeatedly asked that their name not be used. “No longer will the celebration of Christmas be restricted to private homes, multiple 24/7 radio stations, non-stop television specials, Christmas themed commercials interrupting those television specials, decorations in every major retail outlet, proclamations from elected officials, and a federal holiday. Now that the War on Christmas is over, this cherished religious holiday can finally get the recognition it deserves. The President believes his victory in the War on Christmas will be among the greatest achievements of his presidency.”</p>\n<p>At the consecration ceremony for the new monument, President Trump is expected to issue an official proclamation establishing that “Christmas” will now refer to the entire period of time between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, no such monument has been planned or announced.  The article was merely a spoof from the Secular Coalition for America, a nonprofit advocacy organization “dedicated to amplifying the diverse and growing voice of the nontheistic community in the United States,” that poked fun at the current U.S. political climate and the so-called “<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/11/29/the-war-on-christmas/\" target=\"wa\">War on Christmas</a>” — a supposed liberal movement to strip the December holiday season of all religious significance, along with any mention of Christmas itself, in favor of a highly commercialized, secular, and generic “winter holiday.”</p>\n<p>The japing article was clearly identified as an April Fool’s Day prank, but because that disclaimer fell at the bottom of the page, the information was presented in a rather dry and official format, and the article was published two days before April 1, many readers didn’t catch on that it was merely a seasonal joke — and that its seasonal aspect is associated with a particular day in April, not one in December.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/\" class=\"author-link\">David Mikkelson</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">30 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Secular Coalition for America</em>.   “President Trump Announces Plans to Build a Monument Commemorating the War on Christmas.”<br>\n    30 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "437"},

He conceded that it is therefore possible that “some of the Pope’s words I reported, were not shared by Pope Francis.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite many headlines to the contrary, the Catechism of the Catholic Church <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2O.HTM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affirms</a> “the existence of hell and its eternity,” that “immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell,” and that “the chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs.”</p>\n<p>John Allen, editor of the Catholic blog Crux, <a href=\"https://cruxnow.com/news-analysis/2018/03/30/unpacking-a-non-interview-pope-interview-this-time-on-hell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that there is “zero plausibility” that the pontiff actually said what Scalfari claims, as “Francis has a clear public record on the subject — he actually talks about Hell more frequently that any pope in recent memory, and he has never left any doubt that he regards it as a real possibility for one’s eternal destiny.”</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/catholic-church/\">catholic church</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/hell/\">hell</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/holy-see/\">holy see</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/pope-francis/\">pope francis</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/vatican/\">vatican</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">30 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Allen, John L.   “Unpacking A Non-Interview Pope ‘Interview,’ This Time On Hell.”<br>\n    <em>Crux</em>.   30 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Brockhaus, Hannah.   “Vatican: Don’t Trust Report That Pope Francis Denied Reality Of Hell.”<br>\n    <em>Catholic News Agency</em>.   29 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>O’Connor, Tom.   “Does Hell Exist?

However, they are frequently shared without important accompanying context. The series of images were originally part of a 2009 article in a “Germany” issue of <em>Heeb</em> magazine, a satirical Jewish publication that ran between 2001 and 2010. (An infrequently updated version of the magazine still <a href=\"http://heebmagazine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exists</a> online.) In the <a href=\"http://heebmagazine.com/that-oven-feelin-2/1229\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> which originally accompanied these photographs, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090717012412/http://www.heebmagazine.com:80/articles/view/229\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">entitled</a> “That Oven Feelin’,” author Oliver Noble wrote that Roseanne asked to dress up as Hitler for the spread, as she believes (or at least jokingly said that she believes) that she may be the reincarnation of the Führer himself:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As I wait for Barr to arrive, I contemplate the pop culture folklore that surrounds her: the alleged multiple personality disorder, the roller coaster relationship with Tom Arnold—which culminated in a bitter divorce—the theory (her own) that she may in fact be the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, whom she has requested to be dressed as for her <i>Heeb</i> photo shoot. “Nervous” doesn’t begin to describe my feelings about meeting this 5’4” Jewish grandmother. </p>\n<p>With her hit sitcom off the air for more than a decade and the tabloid pages of her tumultuous life rotting in landfills, Barr currently spends her time working on a collection of essays on menopause, celebrity, pharmaceuticals and Jewish life in Mormon Utah (to be published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment) and disseminating her signature mix of insights and insults through her blog (<i>Roseanneworld.com</i>). She briefly kept an account with what she now calls “that shit heap” (Twitter) before deleting it, citing as her reason “the idiocy of people and how ill-informed they all seem.” Today, when she brusquely enters the photo studio, she seems none too happy about having been dragged from her self-imposed exile.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>As the “Domestic Goddess” dons the famous moustache, transforming into “Domestic Goddess Hitler,” I notice that she’s beginning to have fun. She nails the Fuehrer’s facial expressions with twisted glee, and as she takes the burnt gingerbread “Jew Cookies” out of the oven it occurs to me that Barr may be the last celebrity utterly incapable of giving a fuck—a quality theoretically easy to embody until it’s time to face the practical repercussions. “Franklin Ajae, Paul Mooney, Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory’s passings will tear my kishkas out,” Barr laments. “They gave everything they had to just tell the truth, and they couldn’t make a decent living because of the choice they made—not selling out to Hollywood.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The photoshoot stirred up considerable controversy at the time, and from pundits across the political spectrum. Segments on <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLdRit9j9_I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The View</a> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxreiA5bR68\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The </em><em>O’Reilly Factor </em></a>criticized the comedian for the Hitler-themed photoshoot. <em>Heeb</em>,<em> </em>however, defended the pictures and noted that Holocaust jokes are frequently featured in Hollywood movies, <a href=\"http://heebmagazine.com/_heeb_-publisher-comes-clean-on-barr-brouhaha/4502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explaining</a> that as a satirical, Jewish publication its goal was to challenge preconceptions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Heeb is a satirical Jewish culture magazine that interrogates stereotypes and ideas (hopefully in creative ways) that many hold sacred in order to represent the complex and nuanced perspectives that many Jews have about their identities. When we depicted Sarah Silverman behind a hole in a sheet or Jonah Hill dressed as Moses holding two kegs as if they were tablets, we weren’t trying to be shocking–we were trying to communicate something truthful about contemporary Jewishness. Yes, that may sound impossibly high-fallutin, but it’s the truth and while we kind of don’t give a shit whether the magazine wreaks havoc on smug and sanctimonious visions of Jewish life, we do care when our intentions (or those of our collaborators) are distorted.</p>\n<p>Virtually every pitch we received leading up to the publishing of our Germany Issue circled back to the Nazis and the Holocaust and almost all of them were humorous in nature. Naturally, our editors couldn’t help but wonder whether something new was happening in the culture— whether the taboo against joking about the Holocaust and the Nazis exerted as much power as it used to. Certainly Jews have been joking about the Holocaust since the Holocaust (I believe it was the Warsaw Ghetto where the Jewish inhabitants referred to Hitler regularly as “Horowitz”), but these jokes have largely been uttered in private or underground. In recent years, they have been finding themselves in the most public of conversations.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>And what better way to capture this moment in popular culture than by having the original “domestic goddess” don the Fuhrer’s famous mustache? For better or worse, hasn’t the Holocaust itself been domesticated?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Roseanne also addressed the issue during an episode of <em>The Green Room with Paul Provenza</em>. The conversation about those Hitler images begins about the eight minutes in. We’ve transcribed the relevant portion below:</p>\n<blockquote><p><iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Epb3JdQe_E\" width=\"600\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Epb3JdQe_E\" width=\"600\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></noscript>\n<p><strong>Roseanne:</strong> It’s like a Jewish woman. And She’s dressed up like Hitler. And he’s in drag. Hitler. And he’s baking cookies. And he’s really proud of them. But he’s also looking off into the horizon because he has a dream. It was for <em>Heeb</em> magazine. It was their Germany issue. And who better a symbol of Germany than Hitler?</p>\n<p><strong>Provenza:</strong> What did your detractors have to say?</p>\n<p><strong>Roseanne:</strong> Oh my god. You don’t want to piss of Jews. Even if you’re a Jew, don’t piss off Jews. All Jews hate each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Provenza: </strong>Jews went crazy over this.

When I did<em> The Star Spangled Banner</em> — let’s care about freedom, instead of symbols of freedom for a fucking change. You know what I mean, I don’t know. I’m just really old.

The attacks only increased after he and a small group of fellow students formed a small, but outspoken group of gun-control advocates which swelled and coalesced into the huge <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/25/us/march-for-our-lives-slacktivism-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#NeverAgain</a> movement.</p>\n<p>This fragment of a statement to CBS was offered up as proof by would-be detractors that Hogg was not actually on campus during the shooting, that he was at home and had to ride his bicycle with a camera through three ghoulish miles to play his part and take photographs of dead bodies after the fact. RedState.com, for example, <a href=\"http://archive.is/FnkXc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If Hogg was at school when the shooting began, saying he heard gunshots and the fire alarm, then why is he talking about riding a bike three miles to get to school on the day of the shooting?</p>\n<p>I lived one mile from my high school, and rode my bike freshman year. I’m well aware of what it takes physically to ride that distance. Assuming Hogg was in very athletic shape, he may have been able to ride a bicycle around 15 mph or slightly faster. Stoneman Douglas High School is bordered by several major highways and roads, and I don’t know Hogg’s exact route, but he would have undoubtedly had some delays due to traffic and crossing those busy streets.</p>\n<p>Best case scenario, if Hogg were at home, left immediately once he heard the news, and had an adrenalin-fueled ride at his highest possible speed, it would still have taken him about 15 to 20 minutes or even longer to get to campus.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This claim also reverberated through other far right <a href=\"http://archive.is/WjsOj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blogs</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“39 Days” has not yet aired, but an excerpt posted online by CBS News (and included below) includes interviews with the students leading the gun control movement, including Hogg, Delaney Tarr, Cameron Kasky, and Emma Gonzalez. Hogg, who describes himself as a “student journalist,” admits he was at home at the time of the shooting, but rode his bike to school to “get as many interviews as I could.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The rumor was immediately picked up and disseminated through social media:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-26-at-10.28.27-PM.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-134214 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-26-at-10.28.27-PM.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-26-at-10.28.27-PM.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-26-at-10.28.27-PM.jpg?resize=300,283 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-26-at-10.28.27-PM.jpg?resize=768,724 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-26-at-10.28.27-PM.jpg?resize=1024,966 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>However, the documentary clip was taken out of context. As Hogg has said in multiple interviews, and has been corroborated by multiple witnesses, Hogg was sitting in <a href=\"http://time.com/5161034/florida-school-shooting-survivor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">class</a> when the shooting began:</p>\n<blockquote><p>His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a “pop” while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a “Code Red” exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.</p>\n<p>And then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor — Hogg doesn’t know his name but calls him an angel — knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg — who’s an editor at the school’s TV station — found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.</p>\n<p>The shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hogg returned to his high school later that day, in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17030294/florida-shooting-survivor-david-hogg-gun-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evening</a>, specifically to document the aftermath of the shooting he had just experienced:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At 6 pm after the shooting, I took my camera, got on my bike. I rode in basically twilight. And I ride my bike three miles down winding sidewalks and find my way to the school, as I’ve done in previous years. All the while, I was making sure my camera bag didn’t rip open, because if you zip it a certain way, the camera falls out, and it would be destroyed.</p>\n<p>I start shooting B-roll, and I see Fox News over there. I knew I wanted to talk on the news and make sure there was advocacy, especially with so many people from the [National Rifle Association] and different gun-toting Americans who watch Fox News. I went on the day of [the shooting], and <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2018/02/14/student-says-heroic-janitor-saved-many-lives-during-shooting.html\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, “There cannot be another mass shooting,” and I think that’s partially why. But also other people started saying that at the same time.</p>\n<p>I’m looking at the school right now. You can see bullet holes in the windows. It’s insane, and the fact that there’s more bullet holes in those windows than bills that have been proposed and passed to save these kids’ lives is disgusting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>RedState.com included a portion of that interview in their retraction of their original <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/sarah-rumpf/2018/03/26/new-video-casts-doubt-whether-david-hogg-school-day-shooting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">story</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After reviewing all of this, it appears that the problem was that CBS included a very confusing quote without context. Hogg was on campus during the shooting and returned several hours later to interview people across the street. The original story remains below, in strikethrough. I am sorry for the error and have updated the post accordingly.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/neveragain/\">#neveragain</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/david-hogg/\">David Hogg</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/florida/\">florida</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+4 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-control/\">gun control</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/march-for-our-lives/\">march for our lives</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/parkland-shooting/\">parkland shooting</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/redstate-com/\">redstate.com</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/brooke/\" class=\"author-link\">Brooke Binkowski</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/washington-dc-february-19-2018-high-1028609728\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Gruber / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">26 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 April 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rumpf, Sarah.    “UPDATE: CBS Video Confusing.

We also know that emotionally authentic portrayals of these experiences are still extremely rare — and that’s part of a much bigger lack of honest depictions of certain people’s lives and communities.</p>\n<p>Today, we joined an ongoing Twitter conversation about the kinds of princesses people want to see in an attempt to make a point about the importance of telling stories that challenge stigma and championing stories that too often don’t get told.

In response to the question, he opined that students are “having … their First Amendment rights infringed upon” and that the policy was inconsiderate to female students in particular:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Interviewer: “You mentioned your backpack. What did they do with your backpacks?”</p>\n<p>David Hogg: “I think after we come back from spring break they’re requiring all of us to have clear backpacks. One of the other important things to realize is many students want their privacy. There are many, for example, females in our school that when they go through their menstrual cycle, they don’t want people to see their tampons and stuff. It’s unnecessary, it’s embarrassing for a lot of the students and it makes them feel isolated and separated from the rest of American school culture where they’re having essentially their First Amendment rights infringed upon because they can’t freely wear whatever backpack they want regardless of what it is. It has to be a clear backpack.

Lauderdale, Florida, calling it “proof” that González admitted to mistreating the suspect, Nikolas Cruz:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter.

Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again. We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn’t know this kid. OK, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fbi-warned-florida-shooter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed</a> shortly after the 14 February 2018 shooting that they had received reports concerning the suspect but failed to act upon them.</p>\n<p>Prior to being expelled from the school the month of the attack, Cruz had also <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article201911289.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly</a> threatened online to commit a school shooting and was suspended for <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/remysmidt/cruz?utm_term=.qtmyBajznW#.nkwdVoxK4E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attacking</a> a student who was dating his former girlfriend. He also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/16/us/exclusive-school-shooter-instagram-group/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly</a> posted racist and homophobic thoughts in a private chat group and also wrote, “I think I am going to kill people,” later claiming that he did so in jest.</p>\n<p>Another Marjory Stoneman Douglas High student, Isabelle Robinson, called the idea that she and her classmates could have prevented the shooting by being nicer to their attacker “a slap to the face” to both the survivors and the victims in a 27 March 2018 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/nikolas-cruz-shooting-florida.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">op-ed</a> in the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\n<p>Robinson wrote that she first encountered Cruz when he hit her in the back with an apple and displayed no remorse. A year later, she recalled, she was assigned to tutor him as part of the school’s peer counseling report:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being a peer counselor was the first real responsibility I had ever had, my first glimpse of adulthood, and I took it very seriously.</p>\n<p>Despite my discomfort, I sat down with him, alone. I was forced to endure his cursing me out and ogling my chest until the hourlong session ended. When I was done, I felt a surge of pride for having organized his binder and helped him with his homework.</p>\n<p>Looking back, I am horrified.

It consists of raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down. In Nazi Germany, it was often accompanied by chanting or shouting “Heil Hitler” or “Sieg Heil.” Since World War II, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists have continued to use the salute, making it the most common white supremacist hand sign in the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A raised fist does have its own political meanings, none of are associated with Nazis. The symbol has been used by numerous oppressed groups over the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/nielaorr/what-does-the-raised-fist-mean-in-2017\" target=\"_blank\">years</a> as a sign of solidarity, resistance, and strength:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The early origins of the raised fist hint at how it would be used many centuries later. According to Assyrian Origins, a book on Assyrian art edited by former Met Museum curator Prudence O. Harper, artworks depicting the clenched fist date back to ancient times and were associated with procreation, prayer, and “the manifestation of sheer physical strength.” The raised fist became a go-to symbol for solidarity and strength for labor unions, American leftists, civil rights activists, white supremacists, and the Black Panther Party. In 1971, Ms. co-founders Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes posed for an iconic photograph in Esquire magazine, raising their fists in interracial solidarity. But arguably its most famous use in the recent American history is by Olympians John Carlos and Tommie Smith during their awards ceremony at the 1968 games in Mexico City.

That petition called for the construction of a monument to recognize the destruction of Native American communities during the colonization and expansion of the United States. It suggested the monument be placed outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (translated from Russian):</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<blockquote><p>#ПамятникИндейцам [A monument to the Indians]</p>\n<p>The Russian people have always been responsive to the troubles of others. Our history has many examples of times when our people were forced to stand up for their homeland. Despite its position as the “world’s police”, the United States does not recognize the destruction of more than 15 million indigenous people in North America.</p>\n<p>We, the undersigned, in the name of the bright memory of the Indians who died bravely in an unequal war with treacherous invaders, ask the President of the Russian Federation V.V. Putin, the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation, the City Administration and the Mayor of Moscow Sobyanin SS permission to install a memorial to the genocide of the Indians near the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The petition was created by <a href=\"https://www.change.org/u/83237119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vladimir Larin</a>, a Russian videoblogger who <a href=\"https://vk.com/patsantv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">founded</a> “patsan.tv,” which frequently posts videos with a pro-Russian <a href=\"http://archive.is/UDnk4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">view</a> on the conflict in the Ukraine and advocates for a Russia with pre-1991 Soviet-era borders.</p>\n<p>The petition gathered only 7,962 signatures, but it did receive the endorsement from one member of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation, a civic body tasked with roles similar to oversight committees in the United States government. In a story reported by RT — an English-language media outlet run by the Kremlin formerly known as Russia Today — Public Chamber member Valery Korovin <a href=\"http://archive.is/qrnpi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">praised</a> the effort:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Public Chamber member Valery Korovin said in comments to RIA Novosti that the petition was timely and official support for it was very likely. “The initiative to install this monument is very urgent today because it would remind everyone how the history of the United States started. It must become a silent reproach to the modern-day American elites who have seriously diverged from the ideals that were made a foundation of American statehood,” Korovin told reporters.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to the English-language coverage of the story by RT, which was published on 12 January 2016, the story made its way into the United States media market. On 22 January 2016, the <i>Observer</i> ran a <a href=\"http://archive.is/VJb0h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">story</a> highlighting the petition and the statements made by Korovin with the headline “Russia to Construct American Indian Genocide Memorial in Front,” despite the fact that no plans had been finalized:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Another piece of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/russian?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#russian</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/propaganda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#propaganda</a>: Statue of american indians in front of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/us?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#us</a> embassy in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/moscow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#moscow</a>?! <a href=\"https://t.co/smWGSt6lfI\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/smWGSt6lfI</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/20committee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@20committee</a></p>\n<p>— Botond Feledy (@botidoki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/botidoki/status/694149201417093120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">February 1, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Following the coverage by the <i>Observer</i>, the story found its way into a number of Native American specific media venues. A 4 February 2016 article based on the <i>Observer</i> story <a href=\"http://archive.is/UsKMF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">titled</a> “Indians Killed in American Genocide Memorialized in Moscow?” ran in the publication <i>Indian Country Today, </i>followed by a 2 March 2016 <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180327181216/https://www.nativesunnews.today/articles/russia-to-honor-the-american-indians/\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> in Native Sun News Today titled “Russia to honor the American Indians,” also largely based on the <i>Observer</i> story.</p>\n<p>The brutal treatment of Native Americans throughout United States history is a dark chapter that deserves to be memorialized, but it is important to put this specific effort into its proper political context. Valery Korovin, the Russian politician quoted by RT and subsequent U.S outlets — like videoblogger and petition-creator Vladimir Larin — is an <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=eh1oDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=Valery+Korovin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuYNItr2DG&amp;sig=yOkJyEGwshkVAATg0h3wQz_-GEs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeqMXwzI3aAhVo6YMKHXM9DhI4ChDoAQhHMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Valery%20Korovin&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outspoken</a> <a href=\"http://archive.is/HSq4Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supporter</a> of political movements that seek greater Russian control over Ukraine, including the “New Russia Party,” which aids pro-Russia Ukrainian separatists and which was <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl9729.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sanctioned</a> by the United States in 2014.</p>\n<p>Russia’s National Liberation Movement, which frames geopolitical problems in Russia as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union at the hands of American imperialism, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYMr5Q6A1z4&amp;amp=&amp;t=2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promoted</a> the petition on their YouTube channel; they frequently frame Russia’s current political situation as negatively affected by American “<a href=\"http://archive.is/x86lb#selection-123.0-143.39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">colonization</a>” — language that frames a Russian nationalism as similar to Native Americans’ fight against European colonists. RT, which brought the story to the American media market, has been <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> by the United States Intelligence Community as directing a campaign to “undermine faith in the U.S. Government and fuel political protest.”</p>\n<p>Finally, the concept of a memorial meant to antagonize the embassy of another country is a concept with which Russia is very familiar. In 1984, the United States Congress <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/rename-the-block-in-front-of-the-russian-embassy/2017/11/30/b9b432f0-d5ff-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html?utm_term=.bcce147f5c55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renamed</a> the block in front of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. as “Andrei Sakharov Plaza,” after a famous Soviet dissident. The petition and its promotion within Russia suggest its creators were animated more by the notion of trolling the United States by reminding Americans of a dark chapter of its history than by the plight of its treatment of indigenous peoples.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence, however, that the monument ever was constructed or even approved for construction, and there has been no real internet discussion of the monument since 2016.

However, the actual news underlying this claim reported that health care<em> providers</em> (not patients) would be subject to potential legal sanctions under the law if they did not attempt to elicit and report information about previous abortion <em>complications</em> from their patients:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A new state law directs Indiana doctors and hospitals to investigate every time a woman seeks treatment for a physical or psychological condition whether she previously had an abortion that is in any way connected to the ailment.</p>\n<p>If so, the care provider is obligated starting July 1 to submit a detailed “abortion complications” report to the State Department of Health, or risk being charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine, for each instance of noncompliance.</p>\n<p>Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb, who routinely describes himself as “pro-life,” approved Senate Enrolled Act 340 with little fanfare prior to departing on three-day Canadian trade mission.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2018/bills/senate/340#document-0b0b1a82\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Senate Enrolled Act 340</a> was authored by Indiana State Senator <a href=\"https://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/holdman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Travis Holdman</a> in January 2018; it was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb on 25 March 2018. That bill amended existing law to require that health care providers “report to the state department each case in which [they] treated a patient suffering from an abortion complication,” and to require that reports of abortion complications (including psychological or emotional complications, depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, and sleeping disorders) contain information such as the age and race of the patient, the type of abortion procedure used, and where that procedure was performed. The bill says that each failure to report an abortion complication as required is a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p>In other words, the law posits legal penalties (including jail time and fines) for health care providers who fail to report information about patients with abortion complications, not for patients who fail to disclose such information to their doctors. Critics of the bill maintained that it was an attempt to discourage abortions by making the procedure appear “dangerous” and required the gathering of “inappropriate” information about patients:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Opponents of SEA 340 said the abortion complication reporting requirements are overly burdensome and view the law as the state’s latest attempt to restrict abortion access.</p>\n<p>Rep. Sue Errington, D-Muncie, wondered why the same state requirements are not required for other medical care.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that this is an attempt to make this appear like a dangerous procedure, and it’s not,” Errington said.</p>\n<p>Martinsville Rep. Peggy Mayfield, the Republican who carried the bill, said the legislation is necessary for health purposes because the state is the only group providing oversight of abortions.</p>\n<p>Holcomb said the bill’s language is commonplace in other states.</p>\n<p>“This bill does what 27 other states have done to gather information on these procedures without restricting access to them,” Holcomb said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Richard Feldman, a family physician and the group’s legislative chairman, said the bill’s reporting requirements went too far and could create barriers in the doctor-patient relationship, even for physicians who don’t perform abortions.</p>\n<p>“We opposed this bill and felt compliance was onerous for physicians, especially in light of non-compliance being treated as a criminal violation including jail time,” he said. “Further, the list of complications is astonishingly long and many are inappropriate in regard to current standards of care, research value, clinical relevance, or reasonable time frames for patient contact.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana state government</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">28 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Carden, Dan.   “New Indiana Law Requires All Doctors to Quiz Women About Their Past Abortions.”<br>\n    <em>NWI.com</em>.   26 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Indiana General Assembly 2018 Session</em>.   “Senate Bill 340.”<br>\n    Accessed 28 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Indiana Senate Republicans</em>.   “Travis Holdman.”<br>\n    Accessed 28 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lange, Kaitlin and Tony Cook.   “Holcomb Signs Measure Requiring Doctors to Report Abortion Complications.”<br>\n    <em>Indianapolis Star</em>.   26 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "1K"},

That latter aspects appeared to be the case in March 2018, when an old wrestling video was circulated with a claim that it portrayed Donald Trump slapping <a href=\"http://miguelangelmanceraespinosa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miguel Ángel Mancera</a>, the current mayor of Mexico City:</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mexico-and-trump.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-134066\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mexico-and-trump.jpg?resize=600,627\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mexico-and-trump.jpg?w=437 437w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mexico-and-trump.jpg?resize=287,300 287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Rencontre entre Trump et le gouverneur de la ville de Mexico</p>\n<p>(envoyé par un ami brésilien) : une vidéo qui ne sera certainement pas montrée</p>\n<p>à la TV aux USA !!!

Instead, it was created by graphic designer <a href=\"http://www.jackgambrodesign.com/napoleon-dynamite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jack Gambro</a> and can be found on his web site in the “<a href=\"http://www.jackgambrodesign.com/conceptual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conceptual</a>” section:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This section contains conceptual projects unrelated to the organizations or individuals involved.</p>\n<p>The gallery is a collection of unofficial artwork.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A 2006 article from CinemaBlend.com<em> </em>is also frequently shared by sequel-hungry fans:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/napoleon-dynamite.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-133845\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/napoleon-dynamite.jpg?resize=600,173\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/napoleon-dynamite.jpg?w=443 443w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/napoleon-dynamite.jpg?resize=300,87 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Despite the article’s clickbait title and web address, it doesn’t actually report that a sequel has been confirmed. Rather, it reported that “there have been talks” about making a sequel (emphasis ours): </p>\n<blockquote><p>Napoleon Dynamite cost only $400,000 to make and grossed over $46 million worldwide. When a movie sports that kind of positive cost to profit ratio, you’ve got to assume there will be a sequel.</p>\n<p>Evidently the folks behind the movie agree. Efren Ramirez, who played Pedro in Napoleon appeared on the Dallas radio show Pugs &amp; Kelly this afternoon and <strong>confirmed that there have been talks about making a Napoleon Dynamite 2</strong>. He says most of the rumors circulating about other Napoleon projects, like a television show or a series of comic books are nothing but rumors, but he confirms that they are at least talking about making another movie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There may have been talks about making a follow-up to the 2004 movie at some point, but in the years since its release there have been no official announcements about a <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> sequel.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources no-sources\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">23 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "612"},

class=\"section-break\"><span>ORIGIN</span></h3>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>It is an article of faith among UFO conspiracy theorists that every United States president since Franklin Roosevelt has been <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/574478/New-book-claims-US-presidents-secret-information-extraterrestrial-life\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privy</a> to top secret evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life. </p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>According to the 2015 book <em>The Presidents And UFOs: A Secret History From FDR To Obama</em>, virtually all of them wanted to go public with the knowledge of who (or what) is responsible for sightings of unidentified flying objects, but were blocked by intelligence officials.</p>\n<p>Richard Nixon — who, according to the book’s author, Larry Holcombe, was convinced that “a limited level of UFO disclosure” would ensure his place in history — went to extraordinary lengths to preserve that information for posterity, if more recent reports are to be believed.</p>\n<p>A 20 March 2018 <a href=\"http://archive.is/JPleS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> on the conspiracy-oriented blog YourNewsWire.com featured quotes from a phone <a href=\"http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-merritt.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview</a> with Robert Merritt, a sometime police informant and — according to him — covert domestic intelligence operative for the Nixon administration, in which he says he was shown proof of extraterrestrial life during a face-to-face meeting with the president:</p>\n<blockquote><p>… In what appears to be a startling new twist, Merritt reveals to Liszt that he met three times with President Nixon in a “deep underground location beneath the White House. In the first, Nixon read him a letter stating that U.S. was protecting an extraterrestrial being and that scientists at Los Alamos were able to communicate with it and obtain “advanced technology and science.”</p>\n<p>Nixon then sealed the letter in a “time capsule” that he hid somewhere in the White House.</p>\n<p>In another meeting, Merritt says Nixon told him to deliver a copy of the letter (which Nixon allegedly taped to Merritt’s stomach) to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and not to tell anyone about it. Now, Merritt says co-author Douglas Caddy has notified the National Archive that Nixon’s so-called time capsule is still in the White House and he (Caddy) will reveal the location if the National Archive agrees to read the letter to the public.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s more than a little preposterous. We listened to the entire 75-minute interview with Merritt, conducted by self-styled “Dark Journalist” Daniel Liszt, in hopes that we could make better sense of it.</p>\n<p>We couldn’t. The absurdities and contradictions are too glaring and too many.</p>\n<p>Merritt says the last of his three one-on-one meetings with Richard Nixon occurred in July 1972, just after news of the Watergate burglary broke. He found Nixon in tears, fearing for the survival of his presidency. But that wasn’t the reason Nixon had asked him there. He wanted to talk about aliens. This is from a partial <a href=\"https://www.earthfiles.com/2018/03/02/part-2-president-richard-nixons-secret-meetings-with-huston-plan-covert-agent-robert-merritt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transcript</a> of the interview provided by EarthFiles.com:</p>\n<blockquote><p>MERRITT: He had this letter. He pulled it out, and he read this one piece of paper to me. And then he put that letter in a manila envelope, and he put a gold seal over top of the middle, and then he put a piece of tape across that, and on the front was handwritten, “To Henry Kissinger.” He asked for it to be hand-delivered or mailed, whichever was best or safest to do.</p>\n<p>LISZT: Now, this letter was very important. Can you describe the letter for me?</p>\n<p>MERRITT: It was two red lines. They looked like a scientific formula with letters, numbers, and other scientific symbols that would be used, like chemistry symbols. He said, “We possess the knowledge, and we have in our protection,” and he said, “subjects from the Planet X.” And I asked him one question, and he didn’t seem to like what I asked him, but I said, “Are these the things in Mexico or Area 51?” He seemed to be offended by the fact that maybe I knew this.</p>\n<p>LISZT: Okay, now in this final meeting with Nixon, he’s reading you this letter, he shows you this formula, and he’s now mentioning an alien that they have in protection, and he’s a little annoyed that you mentioned the being was in custody or being held. </p>\n<p>MERRITT: Yes. The word he used was “protected,” not “captured,” not “in captivity.” He didn’t used any words that would mean against the will. You know as well as I do that if we had a being like that, yes, it would be in captivity. I don’t think we’d let it walk down the street.</p>\n<p>LISZT: You said he mentioned that scientists at Los Alamos had learned to communicate with this being. What did he say about that?</p>\n<p>MERRITT: That we had obtained a very vast amount of knowledge, very powerful, to possess this knowledge and was able to learn from it, would be the most powerful nation or government in the entire world and could rule the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Merritt would have us believe that almost a half-century ago, Nixon had earth-shattering evidence that the U.S. government possessed advanced scientific knowledge gleaned from aliens (knowledge that made the television show <em>Star Trek</em> look “antiquated,” the president supposedly said), and what he chose to do with it was hide it in a time capsule  of which Nixon never spoke again.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Nixon allegedly shared this revelation with only two other people: Merritt, a shadowy dirty tricks operative the president barely knew, and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, who himself has never spoken of the matter.</p>\n<p>Nixon said whatever nation possessed this advanced knowledge could “rule the world.” What became of it? What became of the alien(s)? What became of their alleged home planet, “<a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/hypothetical-planet-x/in-depth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Planet X</a>” (which, in astronomers’ parlance, refers to a hypothetical, <em>yet-to-be-discovered</em> planet beyond the orbit of Pluto)? What became of the manila envelope taped to Merritt’s stomach?</p>\n<p>Actually, we do know what became of the latter. According to Merritt, he popped it in a mailbox. (So much for Nixon’s adhesive tape spycraft.) The rest is a mystery wrapped in an enigma inside a bad science fiction novel.</p>\n<p>Merritt is, without a doubt, a colorful figure, and no stranger to conspiracy theories. His previous claim to fame was a book co-written in 2010 with Douglas Caddy, an attorney who briefly represented the Watergate burglars in 1972, which was billed as an “exposé” of the Watergate scandal. Merritt maintains that Nixon was innocent of complicity in the break-in and cover-up. Instead, he was supposedly “set up” by conspirators inside the Pentagon and intelligence agencies who concocted the scandal to bring the president down. The historical record says otherwise.</p>\n<p>As to Richard Nixon’s supposed interest in and knowledge of extraterrestrial life, apart from unsourced quotes cited by UFO enthusiasts and a dubious supermarket tabloid <a href=\"https://skeptoid.com/blog/2013/04/08/richard-nixon-jackie-gleason-and-some-dead-aliens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">story</a> published in 1983, there’s little evidence that he gave it much thought at all.</p>\n<p>Said story, which ran in the infamously unreliable <em>National Enquirer</em> under the byline of Beverly Gleason (the ex-wife of television comedian Jackie Gleason), describes an incident that had allegedly occurred ten years before:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Space aliens exist! Ask Jackie Gleason — he’s actually seen them.</p>\n<p>I’ll never forget the night in 1973 my famous husband came home, slumped white-faced in an armchair and spilled out the incredible story to me.</p>\n<p>He was late. It was around 11:30 p.m. and I’d been worried. As soon as I heard his key turn in the lock of our golf course home in Inverary, Fla., I jumped to my feet and asked, “Where have you been?”</p>\n<p>His reply stunned me:</p>\n<p>“I’ve been at Homestead Air Force Base — and I’ve seen the bodies of some aliens from outer space.</p>\n<p>“It’s top secret. Only a few people know. But the President arranged for me to be escorted in there and see them.”</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>“And there were the aliens, lying on four separate tables.</p>\n<p>“They were tiny — only about two feet tall — with small bald heads and disproportionately large years.</p>\n<p>“They must have been dead for some time because they’d been embalmed.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gleason’s story was incredible indeed — though not too incredible to be published in the <em>National Enquirer</em>, the pages of which were often filled with outlandish reports of supernatural occurrences. There is little reason to believe that it’s anything other than a tall tale.</p>\n<p>An entry in Richard Nixon’s daily <a href=\"https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/virtuallibrary/documents/PDD/1973/094%20February%2016-28%201973.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">diary</a> confirms he was with Jackie Gleason at a celebrity golf tournament in Lauderhill, Florida on 19 February 1973. The president’s tight schedule left zero room for a side-trip to gawk at alien corpses, however. At 12:10 p.m. he was delivered by helicopter to the Inverrary Golf and Country Club, where he was greeted by Jackie Gleason. After motoring to the eighteenth green in a golf cart, Gleason introduced the president to the assembled guests, to whom he spoke for around 10 minutes. By 12:30, Nixon was back at the helipad, and on his way to his Key Biscayne compound. We found no other records of Nixon and Gleason meeting in 1973.</p>\n<p>The fact is, according to Nixon confidant Frank Gannon, who spent many hours interviewing him and editing his memoirs during the late 1970s and early ’80s, the ex-president <a href=\"https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2009/04/rn-call-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evinced</a> no interest in UFOs or extraterrestrial life at all:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At one point during our labors in San Clemente, I asked RN if he believed in UFOs and if there was anything to the whole Roswell Area 51 business.

They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence — we call B.S.! … They say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred — we call B.S.! That us kids don't know what we’re talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works — we call B.S.!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>On 24 March 2018, González took part in the March for Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., facing the assembled crowd from a stage — mostly silently — for 6 minutes and 20 seconds, representing the amount of time it took the Parkland shooter to kill seventeen people:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nEmma Gonzalez, a student and survivor of the Parkland, Florida, stood on stage at the March for Our Lives for 6 minutes and 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>“Six minutes and about 20 seconds,” she said. “In a little over 6 minutes, 17 of our friends were taken from us, 15 were injured and everyone in the Douglas community was forever altered.”</p>\n<p>“Everyone who was there understands. Everyone who has been touched by the cold grip of gun violence understands. For us, long, tearful, chaotic hours in the scorching afternoon sun were spent not knowing. No one understood the extent of what had happened.”</p>\n<p>“No one could believe that there were bodies in that building waiting to be identified for over a day. No one knew that the people who were missing had stopped breathing long before any of us had even known that a code red had been called.”</p>\n<p>It only took 6 minutes and 20 seconds, Gonzalez said, for a gunman and an AR-15 to extinguish the lives of the 17 students and faculty had died. She repeated the names of each of the victims and the things they would never do again.</p>\n<p>Then, she stopped speaking. Silence gripped Gonzalez as tears rolled down her cheeks, and the crowd broke through with random chants. But mostly, silence.</p>\n<p>After 4 minutes and 25 seconds, a timer went off.</p>\n<p>“Since the time that I came out here,” she said, “it has been 6 minutes and 20 seconds. The shooter has ceased shooting and will soon abandon his rifle, blend in with the students as they escape and walk free for an hour before arrest.”</p>\n<p>“Fight for your lives before it’s someone else’s job,” she said, and left the stage.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Shortly after the March for Our Lives rally, still and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GunOwnersofMerica/videos/2004494749811758/\" target=\"_blank\">animated</a> images were heavily circulated via social media, purportedly showing Emma Gonzalez ripping up a copy of the U.S. Constitution:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/emmatear.jpg?resize=467,404\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-133984\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/emmatear.jpg?w=467 467w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/emmatear.jpg?resize=300,260 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/emmatear2.jpg?resize=467,469\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-133987\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/emmatear2.jpg?w=467 467w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/emmatear2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/emmatear2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>As multiple sources pointed out, however, these images were digitally manipulated versions of ones taken in conjunction with a <em>TeenVogue</em> <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/emma-gonzalez-parkland-gun-control-cover\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed</a> by Emma González about gun control, the originals of which showed González tearing up shooting range targets, not a copy of the U.S. Constitution:</p>\n<p></p><center>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The fact that we even have to clarify this is proof of how democracy continues to be fractured by people who manipulate and fabricate the truth. <a href=\"https://t.co/cpSXnvLxdA\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/cpSXnvLxdA</a></p>\n<p>— Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pfpicardi/status/977960018204086272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 25, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p></center>\n<p><iframe data-src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwearethemedia2016%2Fposts%2F921131968067831&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"650\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></p><noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwearethemedia2016%2Fposts%2F921131968067831&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"650\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></noscript>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At left is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tyler_mitchell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@tyler_mitchell</a>’s photo of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emma4Change?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@Emma4Change</a> for the cover of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeenVogue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@TeenVogue</a>.

His mother has confirmed that he was homeschooled. But one story, published by BuzzFeed following his death, included an allegation from a 21-year-old woman describing a group she identified as Righteous Invasion of Truth (also referred to as “RIOT” for short) which she said was created — and named — by a group of homeschooling families.</p>\n<p>“A lot of us were very into science; we would discuss chemicals and how to mix them and which ones were dangerous,” Cassia Schultz said. “We were into weapons and stuff. A lot of us did role-playing, and RPG [role-playing games]; we’d have foam weapons and act out a battle.”</p>\n<p>According to Schultz, RIOT members engaged in Bible study at events, and also “carried knives and learned how to shoot guns at gun ranges.” However, she said she did not remember members discussing how to make explosives.</p>\n<p>The claims about Conditt’s association have been <a href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-white-american-terrorists-are-radicalized\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cited</a> in support of an argument that authorities have downplayed his actions specifically because he was a white man whose family identified as Christians. A Christian recording artist, Carman, released an <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/r-i-o-t-righteous-invasion-of-truth/724791357\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">album</a> titled <em>Righteous Invasion of Truth</em> in 1995 but it is unclear whether the album was the inspiration for the purported group’s name. However, Austin police have not yet confirmed or denied the claim.</p>\n<p>Conditt reportedly confessed to the bombings in a 25-minute video police found on his cell phone.

And nothing in their wording indicates a connection with George Soros or any of his organizations devoted to social activism.</p>\n<p>Wohl reported in a follow-up tweet that when he answered one of the Craigslist ads, he received a response saying that although the sales positions had been filled, he could receive $50 for expenses if he chose to participate in the march:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">“Hi Jacob,<br>\nThanks for your offer to help us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarchForOurLives?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#MarchForOurLives</a>. Unfortunately we don’t need anymore merch staff, but if you come to participate in the march, we can arrange to Venmo you $50 for your lunch and travel expenses.” <a href=\"https://t.co/RS67DmzuKN\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/RS67DmzuKN</a></p>\n<p>— Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobAWohl/status/977705804395507712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 25, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>We note, however, that an offer of $50 to cover food and expenses does not prove Wohl’s original claim that individuals were paid up to $300 each to protest. Moreover, we find it doubtful that a significant portion of the estimated <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/24/march-our-lives-could-become-biggest-single-day-protest-d-c-nations-history/455675002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">800,000</a> protesters who turned out in Washington, D.C. (to name just one city where a march took place) did so in response to a Craigslist solicitation for salespeople. (At $300 per protester, if only a quarter of the D.C. marchers turned out for the money, someone would have had to be prepared to shell out $60 million in cash.)</p>\n<p>This is not the first time (nor do we expect it to be the last) that partisan groups have tried to discredit protesters by circulating claims that they were paid to show up. It was <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/craigslist-ad-trump-rally/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleged</a> without proof in March 2016, for example, that protesters who clashed with Donald Trump supporters at a Chicago event were political operatives hired via Craigslist ads soliciting “troublemakers” and paid by George Soros. Similar <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/riot-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allegations</a> circulated in the wake of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2015 and 2016. But although Soros-sponsored organizations have had a hand in promoting and supporting any number of progressive groups and social causes over the years, no evidence documents that the billionaire himself or his philanthropic entities have directly instigated or funded public protests, and to claim that these Craigslist ads are proof of just that earns this a rating of False.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/craigslist/\">craigslist</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/george-soros/\">george soros</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/grasroots-campaigns/\">grasroots campaigns</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/march-for-our-lives/\">march for our lives</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/paid-protesters/\">paid protesters</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">26 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Durando, Jessica.  “March for Our Lives Could Be the Biggest Single-Day Protest in D.C.’s History.”<br>\n    <em>USA Today</em>.   24 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "27K"},

However, Amodei said that Garzon did not act in retaliation over the call when he spoke to the principal at Robert McQueen High School: “He didn’t ask for punishment. He reported what [my staff] thought was remarkable conduct out of hundreds of phone calls we got, and that’s it.”</p>\n<p>On 23 March 2018, the district <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/23/amid-nationwide-outcry-mcqueen-lifts-controversial-suspension-student-gun-protester/455112002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifted</a> the suspension, saying in a statement that it wanted to ensure that its resources “are spent on educating students rather than on expensive and protracted litigation.”</p>\n<p>Christiansen reportedly called Amodei’s office after taking part in a student walkout calling for tighter gun safety laws in the wake of the fatal mass shooting attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a month earlier. The student allegedly called for lawmakers to “get off their fucking asses” at one point in the call.</p>\n<p>Garzon contacted Christiansen’s school and spoke to principal Amy Marable. Christansen was later suspended for two days for “disrespectful behavior/language” and was barred from taking office as his class secretary/treasurer. According to the <a href=\"https://www.aclunv.org/en/news/reno-student-suspended-after-calling-his-congressman-during-gun-violence-walkout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACLU</a> of Nevada, Christiansen said that school officials “yelled” at him for contacting Amodei: “All I want is for this suspension to be overturned and to take my place as class secretary, so I can move on to college with my record restored. I’ve never even had a detention before, let alone a suspension.”</p>\n<p>The ACLU subsequently contacted both Amodei and the school, as well as the Washoe County School District in Reno, demanding both an apology to Christiansen and the revocation of his suspension. A district spokesperson emailed a release to us stating that no students were punished in connection with the walkout itself.</p>\n<p>Rep. Amodei has so far declined to apologize for his staff’s actions, saying: “I don’t call people I don’t know on the phone and drop F-bombs and … when I do use [profane] language in public, I am totally and completely responsible. Quite frankly, welcome to the club, young fellow.”</p>\n<p>We contacted Amodei’s office seeking a comment on the suspension being lifted.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Update [26 March 2018]: Updated to reflect the lifting of Christiansen's suspension; changed rating to \"Mixture.\"</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">25 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">26 March 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sanchez, Humberto.   “Amodei: My Staffer Who Complained About High Schooler Has First Amendment Rights, Too.”<br>\n<em>    Nevada Independent.</em>   22 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>ACLU Nevada</em>.   “Reno Student Suspended After Calling His Congressman During Gun Violence Walkout.”<br>\n    19 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>DeHaven, James. “Amid Nationwide Outcry, McQueen Lifts Controversial Suspension on Student Gun Protester.”<br>\n<em>    Reno Gazette-Journal.</em> 23 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "587"},

After losing the back portion of its body, surgeons worked tirelessly arranging the internal organs into a functioning system. They also created the Camel a new functioning Anus. The Camel has made new friends with the local Ostrich family where they have adopted him as one of their own. The Camel is able to regurgitate water directly into the Ostriches mouths when there is no other water source available.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Captivating as they might be, both the image and its accompanying backstory were fabricated. The image of a “half a camel” has been making its way around the internet for several years.

A missing green “BFF” does not indicate anyone’s account was compromised ay any point, and instead most likely relates to browser settings.\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/facebook/\">facebook</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/facebook-rumors/\">facebook rumors</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/facebook-status-memes/\">facebook status memes</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/facebook-status-updates/\">facebook status updates</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/london-uk-february-5th-2018-facebook-1018754938\" target=\"_blank\">Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">22 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bell, Karissa.   “Facebook Just Added A Bunch Of Hidden Easter Eggs You Can Unlock By Typing Special Words.”<br>\n    <em>Mashable</em>.   23 October 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "73K"},

The picture, which reportedly captured the execution of 21-year-old Richard Burleson in 1895,  included the caption, “All I said was I didn’t like the gumbo.” Burleson was publicly executed after being convicted of murdering a white man, J.G.

A 20 March 2018 op-ed in the Capitol Hill news publication <a href=\"http://thehill.com/opinion/technology/379245-whats-genius-for-obama-is-scandal-when-it-comes-to-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Hill</em></a> by DailyWire.com editor Ben Shapiro was perhaps representative of the phenomenon:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On Sunday, The Guardian reported on the supposedly nefarious workings of President Trump’s data-gathering team at Cambridge Analytica. The report suggested that Cambridge Analytica had essentially issued questionnaires through a third party; those questionnaires, which were personality quizzes, requested that you use your Facebook login. Cambridge Analytica then compiled data regarding those who completed the quiz and cross-referenced that data with political preferences in order to target potential voters.</p>\n<p>This isn’t particularly shocking. In 2012, The Guardian reported that President Obama’s reelection team was “building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>From what is known publicly from statements by a whistleblower and thorough investigative reports from the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Guardian </em>and<em> Observer</em> and a documentary series by Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/data-democracy-and-dirty-tricks-cambridge-analytica-uncovered-investigation-expose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Channel 4</a>, attempts to paint the Obama campaign’s digital efforts as equal in scope and nefariousness minimize the apparent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/20/ftc-opens-investigation-into-facebook-after-cambridge-analytica-scrapes-millions-of-users-personal-information/?utm_term=.7e55d834a936\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rule-breaking</a> and potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-non-american-employees-political\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">criminality</a> of what Cambridge Analytica is accused of doing.</p>\n<p>Although the Obama campaign in 2012 did target potential voters using information gathered from Facebook profiles, there were key differences. The Obama for America organization accessed voters’ Facebook information when they logged on to the campaign web site via Facebook. Obama supporters were given a permission screen in which they could approve or deny the request, which clearly came from the Obama campaign.</p>\n<p>Although Obama for America did collect data on users’ friends, it was at the time in line with Facebook policy. A Facebook spokesperson told us both candidates Obama and Republican Mitt Romney had access to the same tools. In 2015, Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/28/facebook-api-shut-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">changed</a> the rules so that apps could no longer target the friends of users who downloaded them.</p>\n<p>In the case of Cambridge Analytica, information was gathered from users and given to a third party under false pretenses. According to <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a>, University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz which users could download in an app called “thisisyourdigitallife.” Kogan presented the app as a tool that would be used for academic research — but the work was paid for by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook users were not informed that their data (and that of their friends) would be deployed by a political firm hired by the Trump campaign for psychographic profiling in the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>As a result of the scandal, whistleblower Christopher Wylie — along with Cambridge Analytica, its London-based parent company SCL Group, and Kogan — were suspended by Facebook. Kogan denies knowingly violating Facebook’s policy and said that he is being used as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/facebook-row-i-am-being-used-as-scapegoat-says-academic-aleksandr-kogan-cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scapegoat</a>.</p>\n<p>Much of the information the Obama campaign compiled was publicly available and contained in voter files, or records of registered voters and their electoral activity kept by secretaries of state. Rayid Ghani, chief data scientist for Obama’s 2012 campaign, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rayid/why-what-cambridge-analytica-did-was-unacceptable-eb5c313b55f8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We did not build any complex (certainly not the so-called psychographic) models of facebook users using their facebook data. Most of the models we built were using the publicly available “voter file” that contains information people typically provide when filling out their voter registrations forms. We did build models to understand which of a supporter’s friends we want to ask to register to vote, or to get them to vote and how likely the friend was to take action based on the ask.</p>\n<p>We only contacted the people who had given us access and permission to get their own email address. We did not get any contact information for their friend and did not (and could not ) contact any of their friends directly. All we could do was ask our “primary” supporters to contact their friends and we would recommend who those friends were based on the data they allowed us to access.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While the Obama campaign essentially used data gathered from Facebook to create a digital hub of information about potential volunteers and voters to contact and mobilize, Wylie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_loOgecLIrU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">describes</a> Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group’s tactics quite differently. Wylie, in fact, calls the tactics employed by the firms upon the mostly-unwitting American electorate as weapons of psychological warfare:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So [Breitbart.com, Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica executive Steve [Bannon] came to SCL because he believes in something called the Breitbart Doctrine, which is that in order to change politics you first have to change culture because politics is downstream from culture. And in order to fight a culture war, you need an arsenal of information weapons, and who better to go to than a company like SCL which is a military contractor based in the U.K. to help set up those information weapons.</p>\n<p>And so what we worked on at SCL and then later at Cambridge Analytica was data harvesting programs where we would pull data from users of apps and all of their friend networks and run that data through algorithms that could profile their personality traits and other psychological attributes so that we would know exactly what kind of information we would need to seed on to online platforms to exploit mental vulnerabilities that our algorithms showed that they had.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An investigation by Channel 4 <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica-revealed-trumps-election-consultants-filmed-saying-they-use-bribes-and-sex-workers-to-entrap-politicians-investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exposed</a> Cambridge Analytica officials discussing dirty tricks like blackmailing rival candidates and baiting them with sex workers. In one <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/exposed-undercover-secrets-of-donald-trump-data-firm-cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exchange</a>, executive Mark Turnbull tells an undercover reporter that the firm anonymously feeds toxic and misleading information into the “bloodstream” of the Internet, without leaving any fingerprints behind:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes you can use proxy organizations who are already there. You feed them. They are civil society organizations, like charities or activist groups, and we use them, feed them the material, and they do the work. We just put information into the bloodstream of the Internet and then watch it grow. Give it a little push every now and again to watch it take shape. And so this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands, but with no branding, so it’s unattributable, untrackable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In another exchange, he tells the reporter that Cambridge Analytica played on the fears of voters to manipulate them emotionally:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The two fundamental human drivers when it comes to taking information onboard effectively are hopes and fears and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you. And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One Trump campaign official told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> in October 2016 that there was an active effort afoot to suppress potential votes for Trump’s rival, Hillary Clinton — though it remains unclear whether it was effective.</p>\n<p>Aviv Ovadaya, chief technologist at the Center for Social Media Responsibility at the University of Michigan School of Information told us how the information was used is another layer of context:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s also a question of what type of messaging you are using that might sway whether this is a good thing for a society. Is your goal to create anger and hatred? Is it to spread denigrating stereotypes? Is it to incite violence? Or is it a message about how we can make the world a better place?</p>\n<p>Another distinction to consider—is the message attempting to get people to vote, or is it trying to get people not to vote? Those are two very different approaches.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a result of the ongoing fallout from the reports, Cambridge Analytica has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/politics/alexander-nix-cambridge-analytica/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suspended</a> chief executive officer Alexander Nix while queries into the matter have been opened in the <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/facebook-cambridge-analytica-fallout-1.4585694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UK</a>, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-opens-investigation-facebook-cambridge-analytica/story?id=53940084\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Israel</a>, and the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-studies-trump-campaign-ties-cambridge-analytics/story?id=53903252\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States</a>.

As the United States Geological Survey <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-you-predict-earthquakes?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future. An earthquake prediction must define 3 elements: 1) the date and time, 2) the location, and 3) the magnitude.</p>\n<p>Yes, some people say they can predict earthquakes, but here are the reasons why their statements are false:</p>\n<ol><li>They are not based on scientific evidence, and earthquakes are part of a scientific process.  For example, earthquakes have nothing to do with clouds, bodily aches and pains, or slugs</li>\n<li>They do not define all 3 of the elements required for a prediction</li>\n<li>Their predictions are so general that there will always be an earthquake that fits; such as, (a) There will be a M4 earthquake somewhere in the U.S. in the next 30 days. (b) There will be a M2 earthquake on the west coast of the U.S. today</li>\n</ol></blockquote>\n<p>An earthquake measuring 9.1 or 9.2 on the Richter scale (not “Rector’s”) would rank among the largest in recorded history, according to USGS <a href=\"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/largest-world.php\" target=\"_blank\">data</a>, so it’s perhaps not surprising that some people were concerned enough about the well-being of their friends and family to share the alert.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear what the origins of the hoax were, or whether it was intended simply as a prank or with more malicious motivations in mind. The Delhi urban area has a population of around <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/urbanization/the_worlds_cities_in_2016_data_booklet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">26 million</a> people and a sudden mass exodus could potentially have serious consequences.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/earthquakes/\">earthquakes</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/hoaxes/\">hoaxes</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/india/\">India</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/nasa/\">nasa</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/natural-disasters/\">natural disasters</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/whatsapp/\">whatsapp</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/closeup-seismograph-machine-needle-drawing-red-714451780\" target=\"_blank\">Inked Pixels / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">22 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Times Now.  “Viral WhatsApp Message Claims Delhi To Be Hit By a 9.1 Magnitude Earthquake — What’s the Truth?”<br>\n  <em>Times Now</em>.  21 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>U.S. Geological Survey.  “FAQs — Can You Predict Earthquakes?”<br>\n  <em>U.S. Geological Survey</em>.  Unknown publication date.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>U.S. Geological Survey.  “20 Largest Earthquakes in the World.”<br>\n  <em>U.S. Geological Survey</em>.  Unknown publication date.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>United Nations.  “The World’s Cities in 2016.”<br>\n  <em>United Nations</em>.  2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "178"},

According to that account based on police in Glenpool, the badly injured student “was in support of the walkout”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>According to the Glenpool Police Department, a 17-year-old high school student was arrested and another badly injured after a fight about the student walkout escalated Wednesday morning at Glenpool High School.</p>\n<p>Police say the incident started when the older student allegedly took to Snapchat Tuesday night to voice his disagreement about the walkout.</p>\n<p><strong>On Wednesday, the older student and a 16-year-old, who was in support of the walkout, got into a fight.</strong></p>\n<p>The 16-year-old victim was badly beaten, police say, and is recovering in the hospital.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A third report <a href=\"http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/crimewatch/glenpool-high-school-student-arrested-another-injured-during-dispute-over/article_63ed0754-5f27-5267-bd0a-7b5fa5a5808c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed</a> that an altercation occurred, but did not discuss the claims. Although the fight does not appear to be in dispute, the only information reported about the basis of the claim appears to contradict the rumor. According to a local news source, the young man injured in the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-suspended-staying-in-class/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dispute</a> supported the school walkout. That same report said the older student arrested in connection with the assault disagreed.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/notonemore/\">#notonemore</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-control/\">gun control</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/national-school-walkout/\">national school walkout</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/oklahoma/\">oklahoma</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/school-shootings/\">school shootings</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/school-walkout/\">school walkout</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">20 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Adams, Saundra.   “Glenpool Student Arrested, Another Hospitalized After Walkout Leads To Fight.”<br>\n    <em>KTUL</em>.   14 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Marshall, Kendrick.   “Glenpool High School Student Arrested, Another Injured During Dispute Over National Walkout.”<br>\n    <em>Tulsa World</em>.   14 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>KOTV</em>.   “Glenpool Student Arrested After High School Walkout.”<br>\n    14 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "2K"},

This unthinking act caused the accident. <span class=\"text_exposed_show\">We would appreciate you not using your phone at gas stations. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p>In reality, the video shows a car exploding at a gas station in the city of São Gonçalo in southeast Brazil on 8 April 2017. There were no children in the vehicle at the time, but a female passenger was killed and the male driver — who appears to be talking with her in the video — was injured along with a second man. The newspaper <a href=\"https://extra.globo.com/noticias/rio/mulher-morre-apos-carro-explodir-em-posto-de-gasolina-em-sao-goncalo-video-21184126.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>O Globo</em></a> reported:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Erica Lima Thiengo Siqueira, 27, was inside the car when the explosion occurred… A video from the gas station security camera, which is circulating on social networks, shows the moment of the explosion. In the images it is possible to see the driver of the vehicle, identified as Francisco José Gomes da Costa, outside the car. </p>\n<p>…Civil Police said an examination is already being carried out on the car, and that it is investigating the causes of the accident. </p></blockquote>\n<p><em>O Globo</em> tweeted a second video of the incident, taken from a different angle:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"pt\">Mulher morre após carro explodir em posto de gasolina em São Gonçalo; vídeo. <a href=\"https://t.co/62D8gI5Xn9\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/62D8gI5Xn9</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9Lgf99OOnb\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/9Lgf99OOnb</a></p>\n<p>— Casos de Polícia (@CasodePolicia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CasodePolicia/status/851075319129927681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 9, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The precise cause of the explosion is not clear. The driver was refuelling with compressed natural gas, a popular alternative to gasoline and diesel in Brazil. According to some <a href=\"http://www.osaogoncalo.com.br/geral/23743/kit-de-carro-que-explodiu-em-sg-tinha-pouco-uso\" target=\"_blank\">local</a> <a href=\"http://www.jornalterceiravia.com.br/2017/04/11/apos-morte-de-mulher-em-explosao-de-gnv-bombeiro-alerta-sobre-riscos-de-acidente/\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>, there may have been a problem with the pressure in the car’s gas cylinder.  Not one of the news reports we examined mentioned using a mobile phone as a possible factor. This detail, along with the presence of children in the car, appears to have been fabricated by Al Día in its October 2017 Facebook post. </p>\n<p>The myth that cellular phone signals can spark explosions during gas station refueling is something we first addressed back in <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fuelish-pleasures/\">1999</a>. No reliable evidence has ever been brought forward about a single gas station “flare-up” being caused by a cell phone. </p>\n<p>The Petroleum Equipment Institute has studied hundreds of fires and explosions that took place during gas station refueling between 1992 and 2010.  According to a detailed <a href=\"https://www.pei.org/sites/default/files/PDF/refueling_fire_incidents.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on its findings, not one involved a mobile phone in any way — which the group makes certain to emphasize at the very beginning of its report:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Cell phones continue to be cited as causing fires at the pump in e-mails circulating on the Internet. So far we have been unable to document any incidents that were sparked by a cellular telephone.</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/brazil/\">brazil</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/cars/\">cars</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/driving/\">driving</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/ecuador/\">ecuador</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fake-news/\">fake news</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gas-stations/\">gas stations</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/caution-tape-outdoors-danger-1038420718\" target=\"_blank\">Zachary Hoover / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">22 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cruz, Cíntia.  “Mulher Morre Após Carro Explodir em Posto de Gasolina em São Gonçalo; Vídeo.”<br>\n  <em>O Globo</em>.  9 April 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Jornal Terceira Via.  “Gás Natural Veicular: Corpo de Bombeiros Alerta Sobre Riscos de Acidente.”<br>\n <em>Jornal Terceira Via</em>.  11 April 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sena, Renata.  “Kit de Carro Que Explodiu em SG Tinha Pouco Uso.”<br>\n  <em>O São Gonçalo</em>.  14 April 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mikkelson, David.  “Fuelish Pleasures.”<br>\n  <em>Snopes.com</em>.  1999.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Renkes, Robert N.  “Fires at Refuelling Sites That Appear to Be Static Related — Summary.”<br>\n  <em>Petroleum Equipment Institute</em>.  March 2010.<br>\n  </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "146"},

In reality, the Mason Classical Academy has never used Common Core; therefore, the improvement in its students’ test results between 2016 and 2017 could not have had any connection to Common Core. As its principal, David Hull, <a href=\"https://www.masonclassicalacademy.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=256066&amp;type=d&amp;termREC_ID=&amp;pREC_ID=494759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in 2014:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Which is more critical, a solid education or passing state tests? Can we accomplish delivering both? Is it ethical to focus more on state standards than a rigorous curriculum influenced by one of the most prestigious colleges in the world, Hillsdale College? Are we able to accomplish our mission with state mandates and Common Core breathing down our necks? Do we have our students practice for state tests on computers because tests are now computer-based? Are our students at an automatic disadvantage because we choose paper and pencil over keyboards and mice? These are difficult questions to answer, and ones that will be revealed only by time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2017, Hull <a href=\"http://masonacademy.com/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=256066&amp;type=d&amp;termREC_ID=&amp;pREC_ID=663640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revisited</a> the issue, comparing Common Core to Big Brother:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The general theme of the original article argues that MCA is a charter school that has abandoned Common Core, and doing so catapulted the school to number one status. The pursuit of truth requires humility, so I therefore must admit, although the argument is on the right track, the author misses much of the bigger picture. Common Core is not solely responsible for America’s less-than-stellar educational performance. Common Core is more like a placebo fighting a long ignored infection. But while placebos have often worked to bring therapeutic relief to people, Common Core has not accomplished what is necessary to repair public education. What ails our system is mainly due to progressive education, and the cure requires more than a placebo.</p>\n<p>If one is looking for a simple answer to why Common Core is bad, then my opinion is this: CC is bad because it favors teaching skills over knowledge, and it helps perpetuate the decline of Western Civilization mainly through the sidelining of quality literature and history instruction.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>If we are in want of educational reform, then we must see the faults of education for what they truly are. Common Core does harm education in many ways, but it is not the root cause. Progressive education is the root cause, and the problems stemming from it have compounded in countless ways throughout far too many schoolhouses across the country, both public and private. I know that many will take offense to what was written here, but the tales must be told.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, while the school’s students did have outstanding results in English Language Arts in 2017, their mathematics results were not quite as good, though still among the best in the Collier County school district.</p>\n<p>FreedomProject.com reported that when it comes to the statewide Florida Standards Assessment, the Mason Classical Academy “scored number one in English Language Arts (ELA) in the county, with 90 percent of its third graders scoring proficient.” This is only partly true. The school’s third-graders did rank <a href=\"http://www.collierschools.com/cms/lib/FL01903251/Centricity/Domain/4/StateAssessmentResultsMemo2yearsPress.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">first</a> among 33 schools in the county for English, as did the fifth-graders, although the fourth-graders ranked 7th.</p>\n<p>When it comes to mathematics, the second discipline relevant to Common Core, the school’s students didn’t perform as well. In 2017, the Mason Academy ranked fifth in the school district across all three grades with, on average, 81 percent of students receiving a score of at least “proficient” across all three grades. The four schools that outperformed the Mason Classical Academy on Florida Standards Assessment mathematics testing in 2017 — the basis of the argument put forward by FreedomProject.com and others — were all public schools implementing the Common Core set of standards. </p>\n<p>This significantly undermines the causal connection that FreedomProject.com and others made between higher test results and the absence of Common Core.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/common-core/\">common core</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/education/\">education</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/florida/\">florida</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/natural-news/\">natural news</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/obama-administration/\">obama administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/yournewswire/\">yournewswire</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/new-math-frustration-225571735\" target=\"_blank\">Gregory Johnston / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">20 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Collier County Schools District.  “Florida Standards Assessment Results.”<br>\n  <em>Collier County Schools District</em>.  June 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "606"},

These messages frequently started with a sentence assigning authorship to Krauthammer, a definition of the word “pragmatist,” and a brief message to friends of a “different persuasion”: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Charles Krauthammer interesting take on Mr. Trump</p>\n<p>To my friends “of a different persuasion” I’m not trying to sell anything or anyone but I do feel this is an interesting take on our very controversial president who I truly believe is not Republican or Democrat.</p>\n<p>A TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP</p>\n<p>A different take on Donald Trump: (a non-political agenda)</p>\n<p>Trump Is Not A Liberal or Conservative, He’s a “Pragmatist.”</p>\n<p>(Definition: A pragmatist is someone who is practical and focused on reaching a goal. A pragmatist usually has a straightforward, matter-of-fact approach and doesn’t let emotion distract him or her.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although this text assigned authorship to Krauthammer, the introductory passage was simply pasted atop of an essay that was penned by Mychal Massie and <a href=\"http://archive.is/HpAPF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> to his web site in January 2016. The remaining text of the chain e-mail (save for the concluding paragraph) is a nearly verbatim reproduction of Massie’s essay:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We recently enjoyed a belated holiday dinner with friends at the home of other friends. The dinner conversation was jocund, ranging from discussions about antique glass and china to theology and politics. At one point reference was made to Donald Trump being a conservative to which I responded that Trump is not a conservative.</p>\n<p>I said that I neither view nor do I believe Trump views himself as a conservative.[highlight] I stated it was my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn’t see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned. But I get ahead of myself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The essay was published in January 2016, long before Krauthammer’s name was attached to it. </p>\n<p> This is not the first time the pundit’s name has been attached to a piece of writing in an apparent attempt to lend it political weight.

McDole’s hands can be seen moving from his waist to his legs and he can be seen adjusting himself in the chair, which he used after being shot when he was 18 years old.</p>\n<p>As McDole’s hands move toward the front of his jeans, the officers fire on him. Despite being described as having a gun, no firearm is visible near him. Investigators later said that they recovered a .38-caliber handgun by his side, an allegation that McDole’s family questioned.</p>\n<p>The family <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/family-of-man-killed-by-wilmington-police-files-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sued</a> both the city of Wilmington and the police department in March 2016, saying that McDole was the victim of “grossly excessive and wanton lethal force” on the part of police.</p>\n<p>Two months later, the state state Department of Justice released a <a href=\"https://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/executive/wilmington-police-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> stating that the four officers involved — Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose, Cpl. Thomas Lynch, Cpl. James MacColl, and Senior Cpl. Danny Silva — would not be charged in connection with McDole’s death.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, the United States Justice Department also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-de/pr/federal-officials-close-review-death-jeremy-mcdole\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that it would not pursue a federal civil rights lawsuit against the officer, saying there was insufficient evidence to disprove the officers’ claims that they shot McDole in self-defense.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">20 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Masulli Reyes, Jessica. “Activists Speak Out About Shooting of Man in Wheelchair.”<br>\n<em>    Wilmington News Journal.</em> 27 September 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Jorgensen, Sarah. “Settlement Reached in Police-Involved Shooting of Man in a Wheelchair.”<br>\n<em>    CNN.</em> 16 December 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Wilmington News Journal.</em> “Timeline: The McDole Shooting Case.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Chase, Randall. “Family of Man Killed by Wilmington Police Files Lawsuit.”<br>\n<em>    Associated Press,</em> accessed via Seattle Times. 3 March 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Delaware Department of Justice.</em> “Report of the Department of Justice on Wilmington Police Department Use of Force.”<br>\n    12 May 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>United States Department of Justice.</em> “Federal Officials Close Review Into the Death of Jeremy McDole.”<br>\n    6 January 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "598"},

And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election. <a href=\"https://t.co/lcQTBi7CA1\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/lcQTBi7CA1</a></p>\n<p>— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/976147002244378625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 20, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Amid the controversy, the White House <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-election-usa-trump/trump-congratulates-putin-on-election-leaders-look-to-meet-soon-idUSKBN1GW22C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">defended</a> the President’s decision to do so in light of controversy over the integrity of Russia’s elections:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Trump’s overture to Putin was criticized by top senators in his own Republican party, who called Sunday’s election a sham. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there was a “lack of credibility in tallying the result.”</p>\n<p>When asked if Russia’s election was free and fair, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders responded: “We don’t get to dictate how other countries operate.”</p>\n<p>Putin won a landslide victory to extend his rule over the world’s largest country for six more years at a time when his ties with the West are on a hostile trajectory … The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said there had been no real choice in Russia’s presidential election and complained it had been marked by unfair pressure on critical voices.</p>\n<p>The U.S. State Department endorsed the OSCE’s preliminary findings, said spokeswoman Heather Nauert, and called Trump’s call to Putin “protocol.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The following day, a number of readers asked whether it was true that the action for which Trump was criticized was one in which President Obama engaged in 2012.</p>\n<p>A 9 March 2012 <em>Foreign Policy</em> <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/03/09/obama-congratulates-putin-for-election-win/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> addressed the same circumstances under President Obama, alluding to the same concerns about electoral integrity within Russia when Putin succeeded President Dmitry Medvedev: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Russian people and international observers may not see last Sunday’s presidential election in Russia as legitimate, but President Barack Obama has now officially endorsed the return of Russian past and future President Vladimir Putin.</p>\n<p>“President Obama called Russian President-elect and Prime Minister Putin to congratulate him on his recent victory in the Russian Presidential election,” the White House said in a late Friday afternoon statement (read: news dump) about the Friday morning phone call between the two leaders.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>“President Obama and President-Elect Putin agreed to continue discussions on areas where the United States and Russia have differed, including Syria and missile defense,” [a] statement read. “President Obama and President-Elect Putin agreed to continue their efforts to find common ground and remove obstacles to better relations.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The State Department’s statement went on to note concerns listed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe about the election, including that it was not a level playing field to begin with, that government resources were used for partisan purposes, and that procedural irregularities emerged on the day of the election, throwing its results into question.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the relationship between Russia and the United States had not yet deteriorated amid accusations of domestic election hacking and spy games, although it could best be described as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/08/ten-reasons-the-u-s-and-russia-are-at-odds/?utm_term=.5bdbc0bb6ff4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contentious</a>. A 2014 <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33407.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Congressional report </a>detailed how the “<a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/13/a-guide-to-the-russian-officials-on-the-u-s-magnitsky-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magnitsky list</a>,” which targeted specific individuals for sanctions, which along with the so-called <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/whats-behind-the-russian-adoption-ban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adoption ban</a> and Russia’s increasing <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/russian-aggression-against-ukraine-and-the-wests-policy-response-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aggression</a> against Ukraine contributed to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/u-s-russia-relations-in-the-second-obama-administration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">roadblocks</a> in Moscow’s relationship with the United States and the European Union:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The EU joined the United States in condemning the March 16 Crimea referendum as illegal and refusing to recognize its outcome. The EU has also joined the United States in taking steps to diplomatically isolate Russia, including by suspending talks on a visa waiver agreement that has been a priority of the Russian government and on a new framework agreement under which the EU would help develop and modernize Russia’s economy. On March 17, EU foreign ministers imposed a visa ban and asset freeze on 21 officials involved in the takeover of Crimea, and added an additional 12 names to the blacklist on March 21. EU leaders have threatened to adopt considerably wider economic and financial sanctions against Russia should it take additional actions with relation to territory in eastern Ukraine.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While the geopolitical situation has shifted, the claim is true. In both scenarios, Presidents Obama and Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin on an electoral “win” despite international and domestic objections about the integrity of Russia’s elections.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/john-mccain/\">john mccain</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/obama-administration/\">obama administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/russia/\">russia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/vladimir-putin/\">vladimir putin</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">21 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Herszenhorn, David M. and Steven Lee Myers.   “Despite Kremlin’s Signals, U.S. Ties Remain Strained After Russian Election.”<br>\n    <em>New York Times</em>.   9 March 2012.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Osborn, Andrew.   “Trump Congratulates Putin On Election, Leaders Look To Meet Soon.”<br>\n    <em>Reuters</em>.   20 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rogin, Josh.   “Obama Congratulates Putin For Election “Win”.”<br>\n    <em>Foreign Policy</em>.   9 March 2012.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "10K"},

It’s origins stem from France in 2015 after Richard Faille, creator of popular French currency souvenirs, decided to create euros that promote tourism. The banknotes are printed at a private fiduciary facility and they share many of the same characteristics of a real Euro except that they are marked as “0”, hence the name, and are tested to ensure they cannot enter circulation as legitimate financial currency.

Since then the church has become symbolically connected to the refugee crisis.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Although this viral video (which was viewed more than 1.2 million times within a day of its initial posting) does not show “Muslim immigrants” attacking a Catholic church in France as described, it predictably drew responses from far-right politicians known for spreading anti-immigrant disinformation, such as <a href=\"http://harvardpolitics.com/world/marine-le-pens-journey-to-failure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">failed</a> French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who tweeted that the immigrants had desecrated the church:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/marine-le-pen.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-133505\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/marine-le-pen.jpg?resize=600,536\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/marine-le-pen.jpg?w=598 598w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/marine-le-pen.jpg?resize=300,268 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>However, members of the church appear to agree with protesters that the new bill would make life far more difficult for immigrants and those seeking refuge in France: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“The proposed law will make things even harder,” stated Father Jean-Yves Leroy, Deacon of the Diocese of Saint-Denis.</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fake-muslim-crime/\">fake muslim crime</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/france/\">france</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/immigration/\">immigration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/national-front/\">national front</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/racism/\">racism</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/viral-video/\">viral video</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">21 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Le Parisien</em>.   “Saint-Denis : 80 Personnes Manifestent Dans La Basilique Pour Les Sans-Papiers.”<br>\n    18 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Tresca, Malo.   “Pro-Migrant Protest in Paris Church Causes Controversy.”<br>\n    <em>La Croix International</em>.   21 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "902"},

The article stated that of sixteen council members, ten have an affiliation with trophy-hunting lobby group Safari Club International, one of whom <em>is</em> Walter Palmer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of the 16 IWCC members, at least 10 have an affiliation with Safari Club International, which represents wealthy big-game hunters who often tangle with the Fish and Wildlife Service over permits to import of game trophies from overseas, particularly for endangered species…</p>\n<p>Perhaps SCI’s most famous member is Walter Palmer, the Minnesota dentist who got into hot water in 2015 for killing a lion named Cecil who lived in Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park and was being studied by scientists at Oxford University. Palmer was never charged with any crimes, but the killing helped drive public opinion even further against trophy hunting. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Safari Club International, or SCI, has an estimated 50,000 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_Club_International\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">members</a>.</p>\n<p>The claim was widely misinterpreted, with many inferring from reports that the Trump administration had personally appointed Walter Palmer to the International Wildlife Conservation Council.

It’s being done so that you do not recognize that the bottle has been tampered with.. You have to turn the bottle upside down and squeeze before opening it. If it leaks throw it away. A few people have already died in the Richmond area.. the Sheriff just made the announcement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Readers who alerted us to the rumor assumed that the “Richmond” mentioned in the message was either in California or Virginia. The Richmond, California Police Department told us they were unaware of any such incidents; the Richmond, Virginia Sheriff’s Office didn’t get back to us. In any case, we found no press reports of water bottle tampering or poisoning in either location, much less people dying as a result of such activities. Neither did we find press reports of a law enforcement announcement in that regard.</p>\n<p>Had such incidents actually occurred they would have garnered national media attention. Tampering with consumer products with reckless disregard or intent to harm is a federal <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1365\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crime</a> that carries especially stiff penalties in cases that result in serious bodily injury or death. </p>\n<p>Its timing suggests that the rumor may have started as a riff on a 3 March 2018 Facebook post purporting to offer photographic proof that the caps of nearly all of the bottles of water in a shrink-wrapped package purchased at in Bennington, Vermont had been pierced with a pin, needle, or similar sharp object:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bottled-water-bennington.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-133393\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bottled-water-bennington.jpg?resize=600,821\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bottled-water-bennington.jpg?w=600 600w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bottled-water-bennington.jpg?resize=219,300 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>A video attached to the above post has since reappeared in messages by other users claiming that the water was purchased elsewhere in the United States (South Carolina, for example).</p>\n<p>As a number of Facebook commenters observed after viewing the video (see below), the outside packaging shows no evident signs of being punctured. They also pointed out that the shrink wrap had already been torn open when the footage begins, and there are no apparent signs of water leakage inside it.</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" data-src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMissDayon%2Fvideos%2F10155103605281750%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=267\" width=\"267\" height=\"476\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><noscript><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMissDayon%2Fvideos%2F10155103605281750%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=267\" width=\"267\" height=\"476\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></noscript></center> \n<p>Possible explanations for the punctured caps include a manufacturing mistake of some kind, tampering prior to the bottles being packaged, or tampering by the purchaser after the package was opened. The author of the original Facebook post has repeatedly insisted that the video accurately documents the condition in which the product was found. She also says the incident was reported to the Walmart store where the water was purchased. A customer service representative at the Walmart Superstore in Bennington told us she was unaware of any such reports.</p>\n<p>On 22 March the Bennington Police Department issued a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BenningtonPolice/photos/a.388244454593789.93724.179788305439406/1638421892909366/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> saying the incident had been reported to them and an active investigation was underway. The statement noted that the both the customer and the staff at the Walmart store were cooperating, and that the latter had been “diligent in their effort to ensure the water at the store is safe to sell to consumers.” It also revealed that a month had passed between the time the water bottles were purchased and the holes were first noticed by the customer. Two persons had consumed some of the water but did not get sick or suffer any ill effects.</p>\n<p>“Currently, there does not appear to be any danger to the public,” the statement said. There have been no subsequent press releases on the case.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what caused the pinpricks (and we may never know), speculation about their origin gave way to speculation about how the bottles’ contents could have been adulterated. Some people suggested a biological contaminant such as a virus could have been injected into the water: </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">She just sent me a video about someone who went to Walmart and all their bottles of water had a hole in the cap as if someone poked it with a syringe to put some virus in it omg mom please</p>\n<p>— kat (@SEISHUNGRL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEISHUNGRL/status/976090402691452928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 20, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\nThe host of a YouTube video uploaded on 19 March (and since deleted) suggested that the bottles could have had poison injected into them. In keeping with the time-honored process of rumor formation, what started as a speculative notion went on to be shared and repeated by others as established fact.</p>\n<p>Naturally, if someone is injecting poison into water bottles, someone else must have drunk it and died. Naturally, if someone died, law enforcement officials would alert the public.

If he went outside for the walkout, he said, he would be supporting gun control. If he stayed in the common area of the school, he said, he would be seen as supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in the Parkland, Fla. High school shooting the month before.</p>\n<p>He decided, instead, to stay in class for about 20 minutes doing homework after his teacher and fellow classmates left and locked the door.</p>\n<p>When they returned, he was slapped with a suspension.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This story was widely shared on social media, and some viewers who did not read it carefully (or at all) mistakenly inferred from it that Shoemaker had been suspended for opposing the protest and/or taking a pro-gun rights stance.</p>\n<p>But as the original noted, Shoemaker “said he didn’t want to take sides in the gun-control debate” and he was suspended not for refusing to participate, but for “remain[ing] in a classroom instead of joining protests <strong>or the alternative, going to study hall</strong>.”</p>\n<p>That last aspect was a key point, one that led to much online posturing and argument over what had actually occurred, <a href=\"http://www.indeonline.com/news/20180316/hilliard-student-wasnt-suspended-for-avoiding-gun-protest-but-internet-doesnt-believe-that/1\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to the school district and the Shoemakers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The now-viral story is 100 percent false, the Hilliard district says. [Scott] Shoemaker says that the story is partially true, but not in the way the sharers are trying to spin it.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of groups out there that are using this to push an agenda, and I don’t appreciate that,” said Shoemaker, whose son Jacob, a Hilliard Davidson 12th-grader, was suspended.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, users are sending around the photo with such hashtags as #GunControlNever, #Indoctrination, #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder. One retweeter said, “George Orwell’s 1984 dystopian society ruled by government.” Another commented, “Penalized for not falling in line with Marxist social engineering?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The crux of the dispute was that Jacob wasn’t literally suspended for not joining in the protest. Rather, he was offered the choice of taking part in the walkout along with his classmates or sitting out the event in study hall, but he felt that following either course of action was tantamount to taking sides, so he opted to remain in his classroom during the protest. According to his father, Jacob was then suspended for failing to follow instructions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jacob told his father that he felt like other students and, to some extent, school officials were pressuring him. Each side was judging the other.</p>\n<p>“The biggest problem, Dad, is that there shouldn’t be politics in the classroom … I may just sit in my seat. As far as I’m concerned, that’s the least intrusive of the choices I’ve been given,” Jacob said, according to his father. The boy also told him that he was far from the only student who felt that way.</p>\n<p>So Jacob did stay in his seat. About an hour after his lone act of civil disobedience, he was handed the out-of-school suspension for failing to follow instructions to either join students outside or those in the study hall.</p>\n<p>“He stayed in the classroom, where he was supposed to be in the first place,” Shoemaker said. “It’s kind of ironic.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Scott Shoemaker also posted on Facebook to say that his son had essentially been punished for not wanting to choose a side:</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" data-src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fscottshoemaker%2Fposts%2F10213789173717205&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"678\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p><noscript><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fscottshoemaker%2Fposts%2F10213789173717205&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"678\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></noscript>\n<p>A school district spokesperson couldn’t state the specific reasons behind Jacob’s punishment, but she confirmed that he was suspended and strongly suggested the reason for his suspension was the one voiced by Jacob’s father:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No students were suspended for not walking out, said Hilliard district spokeswoman Stacie Raterman. No students were suspended for walking out, though about 10 were punished for lingering outside more than an hour after being warned.</p>\n<p>Raterman was prohibited by federal student privacy laws from discussing whether Jacob was punished for anything. She did confirm that the suspension slip in the photo is a real one.</p>\n<p>“I can say that our students were given two options: one, attend the gathering or two, have a study hall,” Raterman said in an email. “We are responsible for the safety of our students; we can’t allow students to be unsupervised. The study hall was our way of making sure our students were safe and supervised.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The school district also posted a <a href=\"http://www.hilliardschools.org/facts-about-gatherings/\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> asserting that the walkouts were “memorial events to show support for fellow students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School” which were not “political in nature,” that “no one was disciplined for not participating,” and that policy requires they “do not leave students unattended in classrooms”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After the horrific events of February 14, 2018 in Parkland, Florida, students across the United States were encouraged to take part in school “walk outs” on March 14, 2018. Our administrative team in the Hilliard City Schools met shortly after the announcement of these walkouts to discuss concerns and create plans for our three high schools. We met with the Hilliard Chief of Police to discuss safety concerns and worked with our school resource officers. The security, safety, and supervision of students during a large-scale walkout was paramount in our planning.</p>\n<p>Each of our three high schools opted to engage student leaders. With the guidance of school administration, the students in each school planned memorial events to show support for their fellow students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. These events were not designed, nor were they carried out, as political in nature.</p>\n<p>In all three high schools, students who chose not to participate in the memorial gatherings were offered the opportunity to remain in the building, under the supervision of school personnel. <strong>As a district, we are required to supervise students during the school day. We do not leave students unattended in classrooms.</strong> This is the same practice our district implements when students opt out of other school programs or activities. We provide an alternative, supervised location.</p>\n<p>There is inaccurate and false information being circulated regarding both the intent of these gatherings and the events that took place during a specific activity at Davidson High School. These gatherings were not political events; they were respectful gatherings remembering the senseless loss of young people. No students were forced to participate. In fact, student participation overall was well under 50% of the student population. The majority of students were comfortable and confident in not participating in these gatherings.</p>\n<p>Students who chose not to participate were provided safe, supervised alternatives in all three high schools. No one was forced or coerced to participate. No one was disciplined for not participating. Our school culture respects the rights of all students. We strive to provide a safe environment for all students, but we do expect students to follow directions and comply with staff requests. This is required to maintain an orderly school environment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Columbus Dispatch</em> quoted Hilliard’s spokesperson as lamenting that “We purposely let these students create these events to allow students to mourn and to avoid the politics, and now here we are getting taken to task for this. It’s a bit of a shame.”</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/notonemore/\">#notonemore</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-control/\">gun control</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-debate/\">gun debate</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+4 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/guns/\">guns</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/mass-shootings/\">mass shootings</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/parkland-shooting/\">parkland shooting</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/school-shootings/\">school shootings</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/\" class=\"author-link\">David Mikkelson</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Kantele Franko/AP</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">18 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Parke, Caleb.   “Ohio Student Suspended for Staying in Class During National Walkout Day.”<br>\n    <em>Fox News</em>.   16 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Gilchrist, Shannon.   “Hilliard Student Wasn’t Suspended for Avoiding Gun Protest, But the Internet Doesn’t Believe That.”<br>\n    <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>.   16 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Eltagouri, Marwa. “A Student Was Suspended After Staying in Class During Walkouts.

There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2010, he told <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/stephen-hawking-science-makes-god-unnecessary/story?id=11571150\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>: “One can’t prove that God doesn’t exist, but science makes God unnecessary.” </p>\n<p>There is no evidence that Hawking deviated from those lifelong views before his death, and he did not make any declaration of faith after a meeting with Pope Francis.The photograph in the Facebook post shows Hawking and Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016, the last time the two men met. Contrary to the claim, Hawking did not request a private visit with the pontiff; rather, he travelled to Rome for a scheduled <a href=\"http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/pope-francis-meets-stephen-hawking-at-vatican-science-conference/\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a> of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. </p>\n<p>Hawking was a valued member of the academy, having been <a href=\"http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2018/03/14/stephen-hawking-was-a-longtime-member-of-the-pontifical-academy-of-sciences/\" target=\"_blank\">appointed</a> to it by Pope Paul VI in 1968. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences listed has among its <a href=\"http://www.pas.va/content/accademia/en/about/goals.html\" target=\"_blank\">aims</a> “fostering interaction between faith and reason and encouraging dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical and religious values.” After his death, the academy honored Hawking, tweeting a series of photographs of the physicist meeting Popes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CasinaPioIV/status/974265498698469376\" target=\"_blank\">Paul VI</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CasinaPioIV/status/974264675817881603\" target=\"_blank\">John Paul II</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CasinaPioIV/status/974259356278632448\" target=\"_blank\">Benedict XVI</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CasinaPioIV/status/974271683468111873\" target=\"_blank\">Francis</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"it\">il beato Paolo VI che si inginocchia per consegnare la medaglia di Pio XI e Hawking che ringrazia al Papa per la decorazione <a href=\"https://t.co/zVICFDlkaE\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/zVICFDlkaE</a></p>\n<p>— Casina Pio IV (@CasinaPioIV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CasinaPioIV/status/974265498698469376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 15, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>However, notwithstanding his decades-long commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself. </p>\n<p>Hawking’s phony deathbed conversion is one in a long series of similar hoaxes of opportunity. For example, after the 2011 death of the writer Christopher Hitchens — an outspoken atheist and critic of organized religion — American evangelical Christian writer Larry Alex Taunton published a controversial book in which he claimed Hitchens had reevaluated his religious faith while he was dying of esophageal cancer. The book was widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/04/deathbed-conversion-christopher-hitchens-defiant-to-last\" target=\"_blank\">dismissed</a> and fiercely <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQDXcobRbnU\" target=\"_blank\">criticized</a> by friends of Hitchens. Before that, there were debunked eleventh-hour “conversions” to Christianity by <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/59/9/800/248702#2937444\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Darwin</a>, the father of the theory of evolution, and astronomer <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/unbelievers-quest-170478\" target=\"_blank\">Carl Sagan</a>.</p>\n<p>This Facebook post is just another in a litany of fabricated claims about famous non-believers.

As the footage plays, Hagan — who serves in the state House of Representatives — can be heard saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ll fight to secure our borders. We must stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into this country.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the footage does not show the U.S.-Mexico border; instead, this is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-first-tv-ad-shows-migrants-southern-/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">footage</a> aired in May 2014 on an Italian network, RepubblicaTV, of Moroccan immigrants crossing into the Spanish city of Melilla, which is located in northwest Africa and near Morocco.</p>\n<p>The footage was also used in January 2016 to promote then-candidate Trump’s run for the GOP presidential nomination.</p>\n<p>His spokesperson at the time, Hope Hicks, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/264678-trump-ad-shows-footage-of-migrants-in-morocco-not-at\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> of the video:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The use of this footage was intentional and selected to demonstrate the severe impact of an open border and the very real threat Americans face if we do not immediately build a wall and stop illegal immigration. The biased main stream media doesn’t understand, but Americans who want to protect their jobs and their families do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the idea of an “open border” teeming with immigrants from Mexico runs counter to data; the Pew Research Center <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> in 2015 that more of them were leaving the U.S. compared to the amount of immigrants entering the country. Deportations also rose, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-deported-more-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statistically,</a> during former President Barack Obama’s administration, but that was due in part to a change in the definition of “deportation” that originated while his predecessor, George W. Bush, was in office.</p>\n<p>During his campaign, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4473972/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-insult/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> Mexico of sending “rapists” and “drugs” to the U.S. and vowed that it would pay for a “border wall” (ignoring the fact that there is already a wall at the border).

The reports centered around an exchange between Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and acting FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich during a 14 March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on School Shootings and Safety, quoted as follows by the <a href=\"http://archive.is/rV3ff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daily Wire</a> blog:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s my understanding that under federal law fugitives cannot legally purchase or possess guns,” Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) began. “We’ve heard from local law enforcement that the Justice Department has issued a memo that forced the FBI NICS background check database to drop more than 500,000 names of fugitives with outstanding arrest warrants because it was uncertain whether those fugitives had fled across state lines.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Bowdich, can you describe why this determination was made by the Justice Department?” Feinstein asked.</p>\n<p>“That was a decision that was made under the previous administration,” Bowdich replied. “It was the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel that reviewed the law and believed that it needed to be interpreted so that if someone was a fugitive in a state, there had to be indications that they had crossed state lines.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The exchange was accurately reported, as confirmed in this excerpt from a C-SPAN video of the hearing: </p>\n<p></p><center><iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6WWtUl0VdU\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6WWtUl0VdU\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></noscript></center><br>\nBowdich’s claim that the decision to reinterpret the meaning of “fugitive” occurred during the previous administration wasn’t quite the “bombshell” some sources made it out to be, however. The <em>Washington Post</em> had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/tens-of-thousands-with-outstanding-warrants-purged-from-background-check-database-for-gun-purchases/2017/11/22/b890643c-ced1-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> the same thing almost four months earlier (in November 2017), in an account of how the change in the background check criterion came to be:\n<blockquote><p>For more than 15 years, the FBI and ATF disagreed about who exactly was a fugitive from justice.</p>\n<p>The FBI, which runs the criminal background check database, had a broad definition and said that anyone with an outstanding arrest warrant was prohibited from buying a gun. But ATF argued that, under the law, a person is considered a fugitive from justice only if they have an outstanding warrant and have also traveled to another state.</p>\n<p>In a 2016 report, Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz urged the Justice Department to address the disagreement “as soon as possible.” Late last year, before President Trump took office, the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel sided with ATF and narrowed the definition of fugitives, according to law enforcement officials. The office said that gun purchases could be denied only to fugitives who cross state lines.</p>\n<p>After Trump was inaugurated, the Justice Department further narrowed the definition to those who have fled across state lines to avoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony in a criminal proceeding.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What the <em>Post</em>‘s less-politicized coverage also made clear was that the policy change was the culmination of a debate that spanned three administrations, from George W. Bush’s to Donald Trump’s. According to a DOJ inspector general’s <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/press/2016/2016-09-28.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> dated September 2016, the need for official guidance on the issue was first brought to the attention of the department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in 2008 (under Bush), and had still not been resolved eight years later as Obama’s term was nearing its end:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For 15 years, the FBI and the ATF have had a longstanding disagreement regarding the definition of “Fugitive from Justice,” a category that disqualifies prospective gun purchasers. According to ATF records, there were 49,448 transactions in this category between November 1999 and May 2015 that the FBI denied under its interpretation of the law, but that the ATF did not consider appropriate denials. 2,183 of these transactions resulted in firearms transfers that the FBI believed should have been denied, but the ATF did not agree and did not attempt to recover the firearms. This disagreement was referred to the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in 2008, and OLC provided informal advice in July 2008. In August 2010, the FBI requested formal reconsideration of that advice, but 6 years later OLC still has not rendered a decision. We believe this issue should be addressed as soon as possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If the <em>Post</em>‘s reporting and Bowdich’s testimony are accurate, the OLC finally did make its decision in late 2016, siding with the ATF on the meaning of “fugitive from justice.” But it was on Trump’s watch that the policy became official, with the issuance of a 15 February 2017 guidance <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3493269/Fugitive-From-Justice-Guidance-State.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memo</a> from the FBI which read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Department of Justice recently reviewed the “fugitive from justice” prohibitor and the application of the prohibitor in NICS background checks. The Department determined that the Brady Act does not authorize the denial of firearm transfers under the “fugitive from justice” prohibition based on the mere existence of an outstanding arrest warrant. To comply with the Department’s determination, the FBI will implement a new policy for applying the “fugitive from justice” prohibitor. This policy will require NICS to establish that the prospective purchaser: 1) has fled the state; 2) has done so to avoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony in a criminal proceeding; and 3) is subject to a current or imminent criminal prosecution or testimonial obligation.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Did the Number of Records Deleted Actually Total 500,000?</strong></p>\n<p>As previously alleged, the guidance had the immediate effect of causing the names of some 500,000 subjects to be conditionally purged from the existing NICS database because they did not meet all of the above criteria.

Approximately 430,000 of the deleted entries are actually still in the database, just under a different heading. According to the <em>Washington Post</em>‘s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/tens-of-thousands-with-outstanding-warrants-purged-from-background-check-database-for-gun-purchases/2017/11/22/b890643c-ced1-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reporting</a>, those 430,000 names were all originally submitted by the state of Massachusetts, which under its own policy classifies all people with outstanding warrants, whether for misdemeanors or felonies, as fugitives from justice. Since Massachusetts law forbids anyone so classified from buying guns, all of those names were re-entered in the NICS database under the “state prohibitor” category.</p>\n<p>That leaves a much smaller total of 70,000 people formerly classified as fugitives whose names were actually removed from the database (though some of those will be added back in if and when the FBI determines that subjects crossed state lines or qualify under other prohibitors).</p>\n<p>Despite the politicized reporting of the Justice Department’s reinterpretation of “fugitive from justice,” which was undertaken in good faith to conform to federal <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statutes</a> and resolve a longstanding conflict between agencies, there’s no evidence that it was a partisan determination.

As the British government announced today, the passport of Russian president Vladimir Putin was found at the scene in Salisbury.</p>\n<p>According to Prime Minister Theresa May, the passport was only now found in another search of the scene, as it had been hidden under a fallen leaf.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article closed with the claim that the British government gave the Russian Federation 24 hours to extradite their president to London.</p>\n<p>But although it is true that the governments of England, France, Germany, and the United States have all <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-16/us-france-germany-blame-russia-for-uk-nerve-agent-attack/9554272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed</a> the finger at Russia as the likely perpetrator of the 4 March 2018 attack, which left its intended victims in critical condition and harmed several others, including people who came to the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nick-bailey-police-officer-salisbury-nerve-agent-no-longer-critical-condition-a8260346.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aid</a> of Skripal and his daughter, no physical evidence has come to light directly linking Putin to the crime. Russia has denied any involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p>No reports of Putin’s (or anyone else’s) passport being discovered at the scene appeared in mainstream news sources, and for good reason: It’s false and preposterous.

It is a highly regarded brand of dog food, Can you confirm if this rumor is true?</p></blockquote>\n<p>As is often the case with pet safety claims, the rumor spread via word-of-mouth, periodically reappearing on social media. According to various versions of the rumor, all Blue Buffalo dog and cat food had been recalled because of the presence of lead, and a class action lawsuit had been filed after the brand was caught tainting its food:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Blue got caught putting lead in their food and killing thousands of dogs. Do your research please before buying a product.</p>\n<p>— Logan (@LoLoR_2412) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LoLoR_2412/status/948967027108016128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">January 4, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>However, we found only one legitimate recall involving Blue Buffalo brand, which had nothing to do with lead content and affected just one particular variety. It’s possible that the date of the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm547335.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued recall</a> (17 March <b>2017</b>) led to the story resurfacing after a year, creating some confusion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Blue Buffalo Company is voluntarily recalling one production lot of BLUE Wilderness® Rocky Mountain RecipeTM Red Meat Dinner Wet Food for Adult Dogs, as the product has the potential to contain elevated levels of naturally-occurring beef thyroid hormones.</p>\n<p>Dogs ingesting high levels of beef thyroid hormones may exhibit symptoms such as increased thirst and urination, weight loss, increased heart rate and restlessness. These symptoms may resolve when the use of the impacted food is discontinued. However, with prolonged consumption these symptoms may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or difficulty breathing.

The article boasted about how this new product was the most technologically advanced antenna on the market, and that its innovative “mud flap” design allowed it to pick up over-the-air television signals that other antennas could not detect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A US-based startup company has come up with a new innovative and inexpensive gadget that is changing the way people consume media.</p>\n<p>It’s called Octa Air. It is a new “super” antenna that can pick up over-the-air TV signals no other antenna was able to pick up before.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Developed by a NASA engineer using military technology, the Octa Air Antenna uses a discrete mud flap modern design which makes it the most reliable and technologically advanced antenna to hit the market today. But there is a main differnce – it allows you to watch almost every channel, movie or show for free. With no subscriptions and completely legal.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>But how can you watch for free? The secret to that is a law that no cable company in the world wants you to know about. It states that every cable company has to provide additionally to the normal signal a over-the-air signal. So in order to not break the law the cable companies distrubute this signal but in a low frequency- so almost no antennas were able to pick it up reliably. Until now – Octa Air changes that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This article employs several deceptive practices to make the Octa Air appear as if it were a revolutionary new product. For example, several of the promotional images were digitally altered, recycled from similarly misleading advertisements for different products, or both. It features an image purportedly showing the Octa Air on the cover of the May 2017 issue of <em>PC Tech</em> magazine, but that image was doctored, and it actually was created by using an image of the <a href=\"http://pctechmag.com/cover-small-january-2013/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January 2013</a> issue of the South African magazine.</p>\n<p>This is at least the second time that a <em>PC Tech</em> cover has been manipulated to promote a suspicious television antenna product. A nearly identical fake magazine cover was used to promote “TV Fox.” Here’s a look at the two fake covers (left and right) with the genuine cover (center). Note how they all feature an advertisement for the Samsung Galaxy Note II, which was released in 2012, not 2017:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/tv-fox.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132855\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/tv-fox.jpg?resize=600,261\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/tv-fox.jpg?w=1202 1202w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/tv-fox.jpg?resize=300,131 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/tv-fox.jpg?resize=768,334 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/tv-fox.jpg?resize=1024,446 1024w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/tv-fox.jpg?resize=1200,523 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Perhaps even more deceptive was <em>Cool-Technology’s</em> use of an image that purportedly showed the Octa Air on the side of an RV.

This is a very misleading statement. For one thing, the Octa Air is available in dozens of countries that all have different laws for television broadcasts. In the United States, cable operators are <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/media/cable-carriage-broadcast-stations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">required</a> to provide local channels over the air for free, but not all of their premium channels:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Communications Act requires cable operators to set aside a specified portion of their channels for local commercial and non-commercial television stations. A cable operator with 12 or fewer channels must set aside up to three channels for local commercial television stations and at least one channel for a local noncommercial educational television broadcast station. Cable operators with more than 12 channels must set aside one third of their channel capacity for local commercial stations. Cable systems with between 13 and 36 channels must carry at least one, but need not carry more than three, local noncommercial educational television stations. Cable systems with more than 36 channels must carry all local noncommercial educational television stations requesting carriage with some exceptions for duplication of signals. Local television stations choosing the must-carry option and those that have negotiated agreements for retransmission with the cable system count towards this quota.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the Octa Air, like other over-the-air antennas, can provide access to local HDTV channels (from major networks such as ABC, NBC, and FOX).

The group has petitioned federal prosecutors in Germany since 2014 to issue a warrant, <a href=\"https://www.ecchr.eu/en/our_work/international-crimes-and-accountability/u-s-accountability/germany.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saying:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Those who commit, order or allow torture should be brought before a court – this is especially true for senior officials from powerful nations. The prosecutor must, under the principle of universal jurisdiction, open investigations, secure evidence and seek an arrest warrant. If the deputy director travels to Germany or Europe, she must be arrested.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andreas Schüller, director of the group’s International Crimes and Accountability Program, has <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/could-cia-nominee-gina-haspel-be-prosecuted-for-war-crimes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that ECCHR does not expect that Haspel will actually face a warrant; its goal, he said, is that German officials recognize Haspel’s alleged actions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you allow her to come here, you are making a clear political decision that you prioritize that over your obligations under the Convention Against Torture… They can’t say they didn’t know who was coming here.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Haspel, who first joined the agency in 1985 during President Ronald Reagan’s administration, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/gina-haspel-cia-director-nominee-trump-torture-waterboarding.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly</a> in charge of a secret “black site” prison in Thailand at which a prisoner and terror suspect, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was waterboarded. She also allegedly supported the destruction of videotapes in 2005 capturing waterboardings at the prison. (However, a report stating that she was in charge of the facility, code-named “Cat’s Eye,” at the time another suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was tortured was <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/cia-cables-detail-its-new-deputy-directors-role-in-torture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retracted.</a>)</p>\n<p>The use of waterboarding — or “enhanced interrogation,” as officials called it at the time — was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/30/obama-waterboarding-mistake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned</a> in 2009 by President Barack Obama. Five years later, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/committee-study-central-intelligence-agencys-detention-and-interrogation-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> criticizing the practice. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), who was the committee chair at the time, wrote in the foreword to the report:</p>\n<blockquote><p>CIA personnel, aided by two outside contractors, decided to initiate a program of indefinite secret detention and the use of brutal interrogation techniques in violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In March 2018, Feinstein <a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=F2358FDC-46C0-43F5-83D7-903B5DEA5B66\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> on the agency to declassify documents related to Haspel’s role in the program:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As we move forward with the nomination process for Ms. Haspel, my fellow Senators and I must have the complete picture of Ms. Haspel’s involvement in the program in order to fully and fairly review her record and qualifications.

Transportation Safety Board opened an <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article205645529.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigation</a> in order to determine exactly what went wrong and who was ultimately responsible for the disaster.</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>Some corners of the Internet couldn’t wait for the results of this report, however, and claimed that the true culprit was painfully obvious: women.</p>\n<p>An article <a href=\"https://archive.is/CegL1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> in the days following the bridge collapse reported that the Munilla Construction Management, one of the companies that worked on the FIU-Seawater Bridge, was a “female led construction company.” Another article claimed that the bridge was constructed by an “<a href=\"https://archive.is/6g48t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all-women engineering team,</a>” while a <a href=\"https://archive.is/YXpp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> based off these two articles took this claim one step further and stated that this bridge was constructed by an “all-female company.”</p>\n<p>These articles both contained a collage of female construction workers and multiple paragraphs explaining why women just aren’t meant to do construction:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a

stroke of luck as of late. First the horrible tragedy in Parkland, and now this; Florida International University’s “instant bridge,” spontaneously collapsing earlier on Thursday. The two companies responsible for the poorly constructed bridge were MCM and Figg, both have a sketchy history when it comes to construction, but for today’s purposes, we’re going to focus on MCM, because there’s a valuable lesson that can be learned here.</p>\n<p>That lesson is this; there are some things that women shouldn’t do. There are some things women can’t do. One of these is construction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The collages featured in these articles show female MCM employees, but not necessarily women who worked on the Florida bridge. Most of these photographs were pulled from the company’s social media posts celebrating women’s diversity and not from a post about the project in Florida. </p>\n<p>Miami-Dade County Commissioner Jose Pepe Diaz did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommishDiaz/status/972536353547268096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> several images from the construction site on the morning the bridge was put into place. Those images show a mainly male crew:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/florida-bridge-crews.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-133207\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/florida-bridge-crews.jpg?resize=600,790\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/florida-bridge-crews.jpg?w=580 580w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/florida-bridge-crews.jpg?resize=228,300 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Although the headline for this article blared that “A Female-Led Construction Company Built the Florida Bridge That Collapsed,” the text was void of evidence to prove such a claim. In fact, the body of article outright contradicted its title (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Though MCM is <strong>owned by five brothers</strong>, a lot of people one rung down the ladder from them are women. <strong>Some</strong> of the construction workers are even women.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here’s a photograph of MCM’s board of <a href=\"http://www.mcm-us.com/about-us/executive-board\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">directors</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/board-of-directors.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-133190\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/board-of-directors.jpg?resize=600,387\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/board-of-directors.jpg?w=900 900w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/board-of-directors.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/board-of-directors.jpg?resize=768,495 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>MCM’s board of directors clearly aren’t all-female. But what about the construction crew? The web sites <em>Squawker</em> and <em>Sandra Rose</em> both claim that a woman named Leonor Flores was the project manager for the FIU bridge:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The lead engineer on the foot bridge project is a female, Leonor Flores, who is a graduate of FIU.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/leonor-flores.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-133196\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/leonor-flores.jpg?resize=600,796\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/leonor-flores.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/leonor-flores.jpg?resize=226,300 226w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/leonor-flores.jpg?resize=768,1018 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/leonor-flores.jpg?resize=772,1024 772w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>This claim, however, appears to be based on a misreading of an <a href=\"https://news.fiu.edu/2018/03/community-gathers-to-watch-950-ton-bridge-move-across-southwest-8th-street/120395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> published by the university’s official web site<em> </em>on 14 March 2018. The web site quoted Flores, who was a Florida International University graduate and who works for MCM, about how she hopes her daughter pursues mathematics in school. The site mentions the new FIU bridge (the article was published before the collapse), but it never said that Flores was working on this particular project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Leonor Flores ’98 is a project executive and one of 63 FIU alumni who work for MCM, the construction firm building the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge, which will further connect FIU and its northerly neighbor, the City of Sweetwater. She was excited to share her work with her family, especially (her daughter) Michelle, who is interested in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) in school.</p>\n<p>Michelle said she might want to follow in her parents’ footsteps and go to FIU when the time comes, and that it was fascinating to see her mom’s work in action. “I’m interested in the architecture and the design of the bridge, and the math portion of it,” she said.</p>\n<p>Said Leonor: “It’s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter, because I think women have a different perspective. We’re able to put in an artistic touch and we’re able to build, too.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>FIU added a statement at the top of their <a href=\"https://news.fiu.edu/2018/03/community-gathers-to-watch-950-ton-bridge-move-across-southwest-8th-street/120395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> to clarify that Flores did not work on the bridge project “in any capacity.”</p>\n<p>The only other piece of “evidence” provided by these web sites that MCM employed an “all-female” team for this project came from a tweet that the company sent on International Women’s Day:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mcm-international-womens-day.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-133198\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mcm-international-womens-day.jpg?resize=600,504\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mcm-international-womens-day.jpg?w=549 549w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/mcm-international-womens-day.jpg?resize=300,252 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>MCM hailed Flores and her all-women design team in celebratory social media posts on Twitter.com in the hours before the deadly collapse. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This single sentence gets multiple things wrong; Flores was not affiliated with the bridge project, the tweet was not sent in the “hours before the deadly collapse” and it did not celebrate an “all-women design team.” </p>\n<p>Munilla Construction Management is not an “all-female” company and they did not use an “all-female” engineering team to construct the ill-fated FIU-Sweetwater Bridge. This claim is based on social media posts celebrating International Women’s Day and a misreading of a news article. In other words, there is no basis for this claim.</p>\n<p>The misguided argument posed by these web sites would perhaps have been better served if they had focused on FIGG Bridge Designs, another company that worked on the Florida project and whose chief executive officer actually happens to be a woman, although the company does not exclusively hire women. <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article205663709.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linda Figg</a>, daughter of company founder Eugene Figg, was not mentioned in either article.

The years-long but fruitless efforts to find the missing Boeing 777 have resulted, inevitably, in bizarre <a href=\"http://www.theweek.co.uk/mh370/58037/mh370-conspiracy-theories-what-happened-to-the-missing-plane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conspiracy theories</a>, as no official explanation for how the plane vanished or its whereabouts has been offered — not even significant leads.</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>One outlandish fantasy that has made the rounds is that the plane was taken by space aliens, as demonstrated by an apparent Internet hoax that went viral around the incident’s fourth anniversary.  The fake news site Your News Wire published an <a href=\"http://archive.is/8xp3M\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> reporting that a black box recording had surfaced featuring an eerie message that suggested the disappearance of involved extraterrestrials.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nImages have emerged of the wreckage of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, just hours after a Black Box recording surfaced featuring an eerie message.</p>\n<p>The message was in military codesign, which translates to: “Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human sos danger SOS.” The eerie voicemail also gave a series of numbers.</p>\n<p>Users started doing their investigations on the meaning behind the “series of numbers.” The numbers when used as coordinates, pointed to a location near Malaysia. Digging deeper, it revealed that it was within the area in the radar where flight MH370 was last seen.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As is typical of Your News Wire’s false reporting, no “black box recording” from Flight MH370 was found, and the “eerie message” it supposedly contained was based on a purported voicemail received by “Ty,” a Twitter user with the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/strayedaway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@strayedaway</a> who has since altered that Twitter account to make it appear to belong to a 15-year-old girl. In the posts about the message, which have since been deleted but are <a href=\"https://archive.fo/sayhH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">archived</a>, Ty claims a person was taking pictures of him at 3 A.M. from outside his home when he received the strange messages on his cell phone, along with a warning to delete his posts.</p>\n<p>In the message, an automated female voice reads off a series of letters in the phonetic alphabet that spell out the message “Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human.” The message then reads off a series of numbers: 042933964230.</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5UBgqDZewY?start=47\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5UBgqDZewY?start=47\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></noscript></center><br>\nBecause of the content of the message and the fact some Internet users have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mazapanurie/status/975432513232560128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chosen</a> to believe the numbers are coordinates to the region in which the plane is believed to have gone down, the viral voicemail story has been conflated with an all-too-common (but unfounded) <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/hijackers-aliens-theories-flight-mh370-abound-160305081934553.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conspiracy theory</a> that MH370 was abducted by aliens. As with many viral but completely unfounded stories, the narrative can be found on the message board <a href=\"https://boards.4chan.org/x/thread/20474829/hey-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4chan</a>.\n<p>Although there is no evidence suggesting that the message and the Twitter account associated with “Ty” are anything other than blatant Internet hoaxes, it is easy to see why the story gained such momentum online. Nine percent of Americans <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/06/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane-poll/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polled</a> by CNN/ORC International in 2014 said they believed aliens from another dimension were responsible for the disappearance of the plane. Since then, virtually no new information explaining the loss of the airplane, its passengers and crew has been made public.</p>\n<p>In 2015, <em>Wired </em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/malaysia-airlines-flight-370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that the wrenching and upsetting lack of transparency by the Malaysian government which withheld key facts in the days after the plane went missing — including that the aircraft may still have been flying when search-and-rescue crews began scouring the area where it was last seen on air traffic controllers’ screens, and that it had been spotted flying dark and off course by military trackers who took no action — has contributed mightily to the rumors and theories:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The blankness of the investigation became an enormous canvas upon which any fear, rationally considered or raving lunacy, could be sketched into a workable, and not disprovable, theory. Ten per cent of Americans, according to a CNN poll, believe the disappearance of an aircraft involved nothing more complicated than an alien abduction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As of March 2018, the prospect that the mystery surrounding the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 will be solved remains, at the very least, uncertain. On 10 January 2018, one year after intergovernmental search efforts coordinated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau were suspended, the Malaysian government made a contract with Ocean Infinity, an American deep sea exploration firm. They began canvassing the Indian Ocean, which is believed to be the airplane’s resting place, on 21 January 2018. Seven weeks into their search, nothing <a href=\"https://oceaninfinity.com/mh370-seaerch-weekly-report-7/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">significant</a> has been found.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/aliens/\">aliens</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/conspiracy-theories/\">conspiracy theories</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/mh370/\">MH370</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/plane-crash/\">plane crash</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/viral-tweets/\">viral tweets</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/your-news-wire/\">your news wire</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/bethania/\" class=\"author-link\">Bethania Palma</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/airplane-passengers-on-seats-waiting-take-568517968\" target=\"_blank\">AwaylGl / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">19 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Flynn, Sean. “What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?”<br>\n  <em>Wired</em>. 2 February 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sanchez, Ray. “Nearly 80% of Americans Think No One Survived Flight 370, CNN Poll Finds.”<br>\n  <em>CNN</em>. 7 May 2014.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Al Jazeera</em>. “Hijackers?

that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The 18-year-old whom Gibson singled out, Emma Gonzalez, is perhaps the most visible of the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. In the wake of a massacre there that left 17 students or staff members dead, she has emerged as a leader in a students’ fight to make assault rifles harder to acquire.</p>\n<p>“There is nothing about this skinhead lesbian that impresses me and there is nothing that she has to say unless you’re frothing at the mouth moonbat,” Gibson wrote.</p>\n<p>Gibson said in another tweet that calling her a survivor, as many have done, is disingenuous because she “was in a completely different part of the school” when students were gunned down.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez, who has a buzz cut, called herself a Cuban bisexual in a piece she wrote for Harper’s Bazaar. She also declared that she likes to draw, paint, crochet, sew and embroider, cannot pick a favorite color and watches Netflix.</p>\n<p>“But none of this matters anymore,” she wrote. “What matters is that the majority of American people have become complacent in a senseless injustice that occurs all around them.</p>\n<p>“What matters is that most American politicians have become more easily swayed by money than by the people who voted them into office. What matters is that my friends are dead, along with hundreds upon hundreds of others all over the United States.”</p>\n<p>The other student whom Gibson has criticized and ridiculed, David Hogg, has also been outspoken in taking on the National Rifle Association.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gibson subsequently issued an apology to Gonzalez via Twitter, which became inaccessible when his account was made private. The text of that apology <a href=\"http://www.thv11.com/article/news/politics/maine-candidate-apologizes-after-calling-parkland-student-a-skinhead-lesbian/91-528530816\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read</a> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Emma, my name is Les Gibson from Maine. I would like to extend to you my most sincere apology for how I addressed you. It was wrong and unacceptable. You are doing work that is important to you. I would like to extend my hand in friendship and understanding to you@Emma4Change</p></blockquote>\n<p>A few days later, Gibson <a href=\"http://bangordailynews.com/2018/03/16/politics/leslie-gibson-drops-out-of-state-house-race/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> he was dropping out of the Maine House race:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nGibson said he made the decision after meeting with friends, family and colleagues, saying that his dropping out is “the best thing for everybody.” He also said that “I am not walking away with my head hung low. I am walking away with my head held high.”</p>\n<p>Until his comments about the Parkland students gained national attention, Gibson was the only candidate who had declared for the seat, which is being vacated by term-limited Republican Rep. Stephen Wood, who is prevented from seeking re-election by Maine’s term limits law.</p>\n<p>But [then] Democrats David Gilbert of Sabattus and Eryn Gilchrist of Greene, as well as Republican Thomas Martin, a former state senator who now lives in Greene, all entered the race.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">15 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Collins, Steve.   “State House Candidate in Sabattus Calls Parkland Shooting Survivor A ‘Skinhead Lesbian.'”<br>\n    <em>[Lewiston] Sun Journal</em>.   12 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>KTHV</em>.   “Maine Candidate Apologizes After Calling Parkland Student a ‘Skinhead Lesbian.'”<br>\n    14 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Troutman, Caitlin.   “Republican Who Criticized Parkland Students Drops Out of Maine House Race.”<br>\n    <em>Bangor Daily News</em>.   16 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "7K"},

it omits to mention that although Abraham Lincoln did approve 39 death sentences (one of the condemned men was ultimately spared), he also prevented the hangings of 264 other Native Americans by commuting their death sentences, in the same order. It also fails to make it clear that the death sentences did not originate with Lincoln. Rather, the executions were ordered by a military commission and sent to the president, who had the legal authority to approve or decline to approve any or all of the sentences. </p>\n<p>The Dakota War of 1862 involved a violent uprising by Dakota Sioux tribal members in Minnesota in response to hunger and privation as well as treaty violations on the part of the United States federal government, which had a long history of displacing and exploiting Native American peoples since the birth of the American colonies.</p>\n<p>The conflict began in August 1862, lasted for <a href=\"http://usdakotawar.org/history/war\" target=\"_blank\">six weeks</a>, and involved killings, atrocities, and hostage-takings on both sides. On 26 September 1862, the Dakota surrendered at what became known as Camp Release in Minnesota. According to the Minnesota Historical Society, the U.S. forces then commenced military <a href=\"http://usdakotawar.org/history/aftermath/trials-hanging\" target=\"_blank\">trials</a> for hundreds of captured Dakota fighters:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On September 28, 1862, two days after the surrender at Camp Release, a commission of military officers established by Henry Sibley began trying Dakota men accused of participating in the war…</p>\n<p>As weeks passed, cases were handled with increasing speed. On November 5, the commission completed its work. 392 prisoners were tried, 303 were sentenced to death, and 16 were given prison terms.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On 9 November 1862, the list of the 303 condemned Dakota fighters was sent to Lincoln for his approval of their executions. Two days later, he requested a review of their cases and trials.</p>\n<p>In July 1862, the United States Congress had passed a <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/37th-congress/session-2/c37s2ch201.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">law</a> relating to court martials and military commissions which made it clear that death sentences emerging from such trials could not be carried out without the approval of the President of the United States:</p>\n<blockquote><p>…Be it further enacted that the President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a judge advocate general, with the rank, pay, and emoluments of a colonel of cavalry, to whose office shall be returned, for revision, the records and proceedings of all courts-martial and military commissions, and where a record shall be kept of all proceedings had thereupon.</p>\n<p>And no sentence of death, or imprisonment in the penitentiary, shall be carried into execution until the same shall have been approved by the President.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a major 1990 <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://usdakotawar.org/history/aftermath/trials-hanging&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1230&amp;context=faculty_articles\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> on the trials and executions, University of Minnesota law professor Carol Chomsky was highly critical of the trials and of Lincoln’s confirmation of the execution of the Dakota fighters for actions taken in the context of a military conflict, a punishment that was not handed down to other military combatants, such as Confederate soldiers in the Civil War.</p>\n<p>However, she also noted that Lincoln was under intense pressure to sign off on the executions of all 303 Dakota men, and that a mob in Minnesota, stoked by local political leaders, threatened to implement vigilante justice should the president spare any of the condemned fighters:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Major General John Pope] warned [Lincoln] that the people of Minnesota, perhaps combined with some of the soldiers, would take matters into their own hands and kill “all the Indians — old men, women, and children,” if the President did not allow all the executions to go forward.</p>\n<p>If the President proved reluctant to decide, he suggested, the condemned could be turned over to the state government. Minnesota Governor Ramsey left no doubt what decision he would make if given the opportunity, writing to Lincoln to urge execution of all the condemned. A great public outcry arose in Minnesota in response to reports that Lincoln might not carry out the full sentence of the military commission. The Stillwater, Minnesota <em>Messenger</em> demanded extermination of the Dakota: “DEATH TO THE BARBARIANS! is the sentiment of our people.”‘</p>\n<p>Minnesota’s Senator Morton Wilkinson and Representatives Cyrus Aldrich and William Windom wrote to Lincoln reciting stories of rapes and mutilation “well known to our people” and protesting any decision to pardon or reprieve the Dakota. If the President did not permit the executions, they said, “the outraged people of Minnesota would dispose of these wretches without law. These two peoples cannot live together. We do not wish to see mob law inaugurated in Minnesota, as it certainly will be, if you force the people to it.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In December 1862, Lincoln announced his <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=69837\" target=\"_blank\">decision</a> about the issue to the United States Senate, suggesting that the priority of executions should be directed at captives who had committed acts of rape:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I ordered a careful examination of the records of the trials to be made, in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty of violating females.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, the president discovered that only two of the 303 men had been convicted of rape, and so he widened the criteria for execution to those who had committed “massacres” (as opposed to just taking part in “battles”):</p>\n<blockquote><p>This class numbered forty, and included the two convicted of female violation. One of the number is strongly recommended by the commission which tried them for commutation to ten years’ imprisonment. I have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on Friday, the 19th …</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the end, one of the 39 condemned men had his death sentence commuted, and the executions of the remaining 38 Dakota fighters took place on 26 December 1862, in Mankato, Minnesota:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_132715\" style=\"max-width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-132715\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"430\" data-srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?w=2000 2000w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?resize=768,550 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?resize=1024,733 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><noscript><img class=\"wp-image-132715\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?resize=600,430\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?w=2000 2000w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?resize=768,550 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/03790u.jpg?resize=1024,733 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></noscript></figcaption></a> “Execution of the thirty-eight Sioux Indians at Mankato Minnesota, December 26, 1862.” Library of Congress, Print.</figure><p>A few weeks later, the <em>New York Times</em> offered a harrowing and disturbing <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/01/11/90530334.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">account</a> of those executions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Precisely at the time announced — 10 A.M. — a company, without arms, entered the prisoners’ quarters to escort them to their doom. Instead of any shrinking or resistance, all were ready, and even seemed eager to meet their fate. Rudely they jostled against each other, as they rushed from the doorway, ran the gauntlet of the troops, and clambered up the steps to the treacherous drop.</p>\n<p>As they came up and reached the platform, they filed right and left, and each one took his position as though they had rehearsed the programme. Standing round the platform, they formed a square, and each one was directly under the fatal noose. Their caps were now drawn over their eyes, and the halter placed about their necks. Several of them feeling uncomfortable, made severe efforts to loosen the rope, and some, after the most dreadful contortions, partially succeeded.</p>\n<p>The signal to cut the rope was three taps of the drum. All things being ready, the first tap was given, when the poor wretches made such frantic efforts to grasp each other’s hands, that it was agony to behold them. Each one shouted out his name, that his comrades might know he was there. The second tap resounded on the air. The vast multitude were breathless with the awful surroundings of this solemn occasion. Again the doleful tap breaks on the stillness of the scene.</p>\n<p>Click! goes the sharp ax, and the descending platform leaves the bodies of thirty-eight human beings dangling in the air. The greater part died instantly; some few struggled violently, and one of the ropes broke, and sent its burden with a heavy, dull crash, to the platform beneath. A new rope was procured, and the body again swung up to its place. It was an awful sight to behold. Thirty-eight human beings suspended in the air, on the bank of the beautiful Minnesota; above, the smiling, clear, blue sky; beneath and around, the silent thousands, hushed to a deathly silence by the chilling scene before them, while the bayonets bristling in the sunlight added to the importance of the occasion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is accurate to say that Lincoln approved the executions of 39 Dakota fighters, and that despite their convictions for participating in war-time massacres, the condemned men were not afforded the conventional rights of due process (such as trial by jury) and did not have attorneys present to plead on their behalf. It is also true that Lincoln, as President of the United States, did have the legal authority to commute all 303 death sentences presented to him for his approval.</p>\n<p>However, in the very act of approving 39 executions, Lincoln was at the same time ordering the commutation of 264 death sentences. Despite intense political and popular pressure, Lincoln spared the lives of many more Dakota fighters than he condemned, albeit not as many as he could have.

That report made no mention of the Trump administration, instead arguing that Damon’s close relationship with Australian Chris Hemsworth was the driving force behind the the actor’s alleged decision to purchase a home in Byron Bay.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Telegraph’s </em>headline may have stated that Damon was “in the process” of buying a house in Australia, but the actual language of the article made it clear that this claim was based on speculation and rumor (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jason Bourne star Matt Damon, close friend to Byron local Chris Hemsworth, is <strong>said to be</strong> in the process of buying a property near Hemsworth’s Broken Head pad.</p>\n<p>Damon, his wife Luciana Barroso and their four children visited Byron last April and returned for a New Year’s Eve party at the Hemsworth’s. The bash was also attended by Hemsworth’s brother Liam and his partner Miley Cyrus.</p>\n<p>Now <strong>speculation is rife</strong> that the bromance has been sealed with a slice of a neighbouring property.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p><strong>There are no listings for properties nearby</strong> but one agent, who asked not to be named, said a deal with a neighbouring property was possibly negotiated on the quiet.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Regardless, the <em><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/03/15/matt-damon-moving-family-to-australia-because-of-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">NY Post</a> </em>ran with this story and even added their own political twist: The move was directly related to Damon’s attitude toward the president. </p>\n<blockquote><p>A source exclusively tells Page Six: “Matt’s telling friends and colleagues in Hollywood that he’s moving the family to Australia” because the activist actor disagrees with Trump’s policies. The president’s frequently butted heads with liberal Hollywood A-listers including Meryl Streep. The source added, “Matt’s saying the move will not impact his work — as he will travel to wherever his projects are shooting.

he says the <a href=\"http://archive.is/YEcMI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incident</a> involved the principal of the school “escorting” a student off school property for apparently engaging in a counterprotest and holding a placard that read “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” The video was viewed more than 2 million times within a day:</p>\n<p></p><center><iframe style=\"border: none;

The video does not show a student being removed from school property, nor does it show the older man threatening to call the police on the student.\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.npaschools.org/high-school-incident-response\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> on 15 March 2018, the New Prague Area Schools District site confirmed that there had been an incident involving a student holding a placard, but did not make it clear whether the older man in the video was, in fact, the principal of New Prague High School:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yesterday approximately 100 of our high school students participated in a walkout, as did many of their peers across the country.  The walkout was conducted peacefully and without conflict.  Since then, attention has been focused on a sign that was present during the walkout.</p>\n<p>The District has a policy that such items must be submitted to and reviewed by school administration at least 24-hours in advance.  In compliance with the District’s policy “… to protect the exercise of students’ and employees’ free speech rights, [while] taking into consideration the educational objectives and responsibilities of the School District,” the sign was moved to non-school grounds. The District has an obligation to enforce this policy without regard to political viewpoint.</p>\n<p>No student was disciplined and law enforcement was not involved with any of the students present during the walkout.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While the school district stated that the sign was “moved to non-school grounds,” it did not specify whether the person holding the sign was also escorted or removed from school property. School authorities also noted that law enforcement did not become involved in the incident, but did not specify whether the older man shown in the video at any time threatened to call the police.</p>\n<p>The New Prague Area School District does indeed have a policy which requires that any “non-school sponsored material” to be displayed on campus must be submitted to the principal for approval, 24 hours ahead of time. Section 6 of the district’s Policy 505 <a href=\"http://www.npaschools.org/sites/default/files/505.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">states</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Any student or employee wishing to distribute (as defined in this policy) non-school sponsored material must first submit for approval a copy of the material to the principal at least 24 hours in advance of desired distribution time, together with the following information:</p>\n<p>1. Name and phone number of the person submitting the request and, if a student, the room number of his or her first-period class.<br>\n2. Date(s) and time(s) of day intended display or distribution.<br>\n3. Location where material will be displayed or distributed;<br>\n4. If intended for students, the grade(s) of students to whom the display or distribution is intended.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At one point in the video posted to Facebook, there is an exchange in which the older man appears to invoke “Policy 505,” although the video is so truncated that the context is unclear.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Younger man:</strong> …No you don’t<br><strong>Older man:</strong> Yeah we do. Policy 505 —<br><strong>Younger man:</strong> Supreme Court —<br><strong>Older man:</strong> 505…[inaudible]</p></blockquote>\n<p>There was an incident on the campus of New Prague High School in Minnesota, during the national walkout protest against gun violence on 14 March 2018, and a pro-gun rights sign was, according to school authorities, removed from the school’s property. </p>\n<p>However, it is not clear whether the school’s principal escorted the student who held the sign off campus, nor whether the principal threatened to call the police on that student. So far, we have not seen any evidence to support those claims, other than the testimony of the person who posted the video to Facebook.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have seen no evidence that the sign was targeted for removal specifically because it contained a pro-gun rights message. The New Prague School District has specifically stated that the sign was removed “without regard to political viewpoint,” and because it was not submitted for approval in advance of the demonstration, which is a violation of school district policy. </p>\n<p>We asked the school district for more details but have not yet heard back.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-control/\">gun control</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/guns/\">guns</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/minnesota/\">minnesota</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/parkland-shooting/\">parkland shooting</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">15 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>New Prague Area School District.  “High School Incident Response.”<br>\n  <em>New Prague Area School District</em>.  15 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>New Prague Area School District.  “Policy 505 — Distribution of Non-School-Sponsored Materials on School Premises By Students and Employees.”  <br>\n<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif\">  <em>New Prague Area School District</em>.  24 August 2015</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "626"},

Alexander was believed to have been providing instruction related to public safety awareness when he fired a single shot from a semi-automatic handgun into the ceiling.</p>\n<p>According to Seaside Police Chief Abdul D. Pridgen, a student was struck in the neck by debris or a fragment after the bullet ricocheted off the ceiling. The student was not seriously injured. Pridgen said class resumed after the incident was brought under control.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Monterey Peninsula Unified School District (MPUSD) released a statement the same day which read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The safety and well-being of students and staff are high priorities for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District. Today, an accident occurred in the Administration of Justice class at Seaside High School. During class, the teacher, who is also a reserve police officer, accidentally discharged his firearm during a lesson while it was pointed at the ceiling, and debris from the ceiling then fell.</p>\n<p>Upon learning of the incident, school site administration, the District Office, and the Seaside Police Department immediately began investigating, including interviewing students in the class. It was determined that there was no immediate threat to students or staff, and school remained in session.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of this personnel incident, we are unable to share any other details at this time. The teacher has been placed on administrative leave for the duration of the on-going investigation.</p>\n<p>California law prohibits firearms on campus, and MPUSD’s Board of Education policy prohibits any person other than authorized law enforcement or security personnel from possessing weapons, imitation firearms, or dangerous instruments of any kind in school buildings, on school grounds or buses, or at a school-related or school-sponsored activity away from school, or while going to or coming from school.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The school district informed us that the teacher has been with Seaside High School since 1994 and formerly taught mathematics, though more recently his only responsibility was teaching the Administration of Justice course during which the accident occurred. MPUSD declined to comment further, noting that the matter is still under investigation and there have been “multiple and differing accounts of the incident and the response immediately following.”</p>\n<p>Some early press reports said that as many as three students had suffered superficial injuries, but according to the most recent coverage only one student, a 17-year-old male, was confirmed injured. Chief Abdul D. Pridgen of the Seaside Police Department said the wound was caused by a bullet fragment or debris falling from the ceiling. The student was treated at a local hospital and released.</p>\n<p>MPUSD superintendent Daniel “PK” Diffenbaugh told KSBW-TV News that among the questions that need to be answered is why a teacher was pointing a loaded gun at the ceiling in front of students. “Clearly in this incident protocols were not followed,” he said.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, a similar incident <a href=\"https://wtop.com/alexandria/2018/03/school-resource-officer-accidentally-fires-weapon-alexandria-middle-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">occurred</a> the same day at a middle school in Alexandria, Virginia. Police reported that a school resource officer accidentally discharged his pistol while sitting down in his office at George Washington Middle School. No injuries were reported, and the officer, a five-year veteran of the police department, was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. The accident brought the total number of confirmed gunfire <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/school-shootings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incidents</a> in U.S. schools so far in 2018 to 32, according to the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. </p>\n<p>Both accidents added fuel to an ongoing national debate over proposals by the Trump administration, the National Rifle Association, and other gun rights advocacy groups to arm teachers to defend their students in the event of school shootings. According to a March 2018 <a href=\"http://krwg.org/post/new-nea-national-survey-educators-overwhelmingly-reject-proposals-arm-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poll</a> of National Education Association members, educators “overwhelmingly reject” such proposals as “ill-conceived, preposterous, and dangerous.” Supporters of the proposals say arming and training teachers and other school personnel would make classrooms more safe, not less.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/armed-teachers/\">armed teachers</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/california/\">california</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-safety/\">gun safety</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+4 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/guns/\">guns</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/school-shootings/\">school shootings</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/teachers/\">teachers</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/virginia/\">virginia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/gun-close-bullets-reflecting-on-white-1025745490\" target=\"_blank\">VDjokich / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">15 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Herrera, James.  “Investigation Continues in Seaside High Teacher’s Shooting of Gun in Classroom.”<br>\n  <em>Monterey Herald</em>.  14 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Larson, Amy.  “Seaside High Teacher Accidentally Fires Gun in Class, Students Injured.”<br>\n  <em>KSBW News</em>.  14 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Moore, Jack.  “School Resource Officer Accidentally Fires Weapon at Alexandria Middle School.”<br>\n  <em>WTOP News</em>.  13 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rosenblatt, Kalhan, Chuck, Elizabeth, and Sperling, Jonathan.  “Students Demand Action on Gun Violence with Nationwide Walkout.”<br>\n  <em>NBC News</em>.  14 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Schmatz, David.  “Seaside Teacher, Councilman and Reserve Officer Accidentally Discharges Weapon in a Classroom.”<br>\n  <em>Monterey County Weekly</em>.  13 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>KRWG News</em>.  “New NEA National Survey: Educators Overwhelmingly Reject Proposals to Arm Teachers.”<br>\n  13 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Monterey Herald</em>.  “Police: Seaside High Teacher Believed to Have Accidentally Fired Gun in Class.”<br>\n  13 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "2K"},

There is no coincidence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This image truly does show a young Angela Merkel. However, the other two women in the vintage photograph are not either Theresa May or Dalia Grybauskaitė. An uncropped version of the old photograph was published in a <em>Time </em><a href=\"http://time.com/4139636/time-person-of-the-year-angela-merkel-young-photos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> about Merkel’s life after she was awarded the magazine’s “Person of the Year” award in 2015. The magazine identified the woman on the left as 18-year-old Angela Merkel (née Kasner), and the other two women were simply identified as friends:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Angela Kasner, 18, with friends at a New Year’s Eve party in Berlin in 1972.</p>\n<p>Glaescher/laif/Redux</p></blockquote>\n<p>CNN provided a similar <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/19/europe/gallery/angela-merkel-career/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">caption</a> when they included the image in a gallery of the German leader:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Merkel, left, attends a New Year’s Eve party with friends in Berlin in 1972.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We haven’t been able to identify the two “friends” in this photograph, but they are not past or present leaders of either the UK or Lithuania. That claim was simply made up out of whole cloth.</p>\n<p>Merkel, May, and Grybauskaitė are all approximately the same age (they were born in 1954, 1956, and 1956, respectively). However, it’s unlikely that these world leaders knew each other in their youth. After all, they were all raised in different countries — Germany, the United Kingdom, and Lithuania respectively — and attended different high schools and colleges; anyone who has attended a party as a teenager knows how difficult it can be to find a ride across town, much less to a different country.</p>\n<p>We were unable to find a photograph of Grybauskaitė from the comparable time period, but we did locate an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/education-37322295\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">image</a> of May from 1971 (a year before this viral photograph was taken). Comparing these two images makes it clear that May was not photographed at this party with Merkel, as the only resemblance between the two is that both possibly (but not definitely) have dark hair:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/theresa-may-and-not-theresa-may.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-132996\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/theresa-may-and-not-theresa-may.jpg?resize=600,462\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/theresa-may-and-not-theresa-may.jpg?w=800 800w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/theresa-may-and-not-theresa-may.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/theresa-may-and-not-theresa-may.jpg?resize=768,591 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>While we have been unable to positively identify the other two friends in the image or find a photograph of Grybauskaitė from that time period, the existence of the image of young Theresa May discredits the entire claim by rendering one of its central aspects completely moot.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/angela-merkel/\">angela merkel</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/dalia-grybauskaite/\">Dalia Grybauskaitė</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fake-photos/\">fake photos</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/theresa-may/\">theresa may</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/vintage/\">vintage</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">16 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Time</em>.   “See Vintage Photos of a Young Angela Merkel.”<br>\n    9 December 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "3K"},

No link to any supporting information was included, but Avaaz said that guns kill more than “1,300 American kids a year.” Approximately five years and three months passed between the Sandy Hook shooting and the demonstration; in that period of time by those figures, the number of children killed by guns would be roughly 6,825.</p>\n<p>Using the CDC’s database search <a href=\"https://wonder.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tool</a>, we were unable to arrive at precisely the same numbers due to the way such information is catalogued and presented. The parameters available were slightly different, and we were able to access statistics for every recorded death of an individual under the age of 18 for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 (the system does not yet have data for 2017). The four-year tally for all firearm deaths in that truncated period was 5,683, which per year broke down slightly <em>higher</em> at 1,421 firearm deaths on average among those under the age of 18. When extrapolated to the five-year, three-month period the empty shoes protest encompasses, the number is closer to 7,460.</p>\n<p>We contacted Avaaz to ask about the source of their numbers, and they replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We arrived at the number based on CDC estimates of ~1300 kids killed by guns a year (a number the CDC calls conservative). Since the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Dec 2012 until now, the math shakes out to roughly 7000 kids (0-17) killed by guns since then.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The demonstration was genuine and took place on 13 March 2018.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Variations:</strong></span> On 16 March 2018, an initiative published by the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP)’s AAP News <a href=\"http://www.aappublications.org/news/2018/03/16/guninitiative031618\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reiterated</a> CDC statistics indicating 1,300 children in the United States died of gunfire on average each year.

A Department of Defense document did not measure the two against one another, but it did provide the total number of war-related deaths in five separate campaigns after 11 September 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/casualty.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.li/ZvCoE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">archived</a>]. </p>\n<p>According to that document updated on 23 March 2018, casualties both in combat and those classed as “non-hostile” were listed as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Operation Iraqi Freedom: 4,424</li>\n<li>Operation New Dawn: 73</li>\n<li>Operation Enduring Freedom: 2,350</li>\n<li>Operation Inherent Resolve: 61</li>\n<li>Operation Freedom’s Sentinel: 49</li>\n</ul><p>The number of American soldiers killed in all campaigns combined following 9/11 totaled 6,957. The AAP’s statistic of 1,300 child deaths annually could be contrasted using the same figures in 16.5 years since 11 September 2001. In that period, approximately 422 soldiers died in active campaigns per year. </p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Updated [26 March 2018]: Added \"Variations\" section. </p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/avaaz/\">avaaz</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/empty-shoes/\">empty shoes</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-deaths/\">gun deaths</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/sandy-hook/\">sandy hook</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">13 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">26 March 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Jenco, Melissa.   “Call To Action: New AAP Research Initiative Aims To Protect Children From Firearm Injuries.”<br>\n    <em>AAP News</em>.   16 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sit, Ryan.   “More Children Have Been Killed By Guns Since Sandy Hook Than U.S. Soldiers In Combat Since 9/11.”<br>\n    <em>Newsweek</em>.   16 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>CDC WONDER</em>.   “Underlying Cause Of Death, 2013-2016 Results.”<br>\n    Accessed 13 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Avaaz</em>.   “Monument For Our Kids.”<br>\n    11 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>United States Department of Defense</em>.   “Defense.gov/casualty.pdf.”<br>\n    Accessed 26 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "6K"},

It took nine months, but the reply arrived last week: 54 pages of total blackout.</p>\n<p>Every word of every inspection — from the date to the violations — were redacted from the documents provided. Providing “personnel and medical files,” the agency said, would “constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” These records used to be available on the USDA web site for anyone to search and find. But in the first month after President Donald Trump took office, the information was scrubbed entirely from the web site. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The article goes on to claim that USDA inspection reports were previously available to the public, but “under the Trump administration, they are not.”</p>\n<p>In reality, the USDA temporarily removed a searchable database of inspection reports from its web site as part of a review that began before the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations and was connected to a lawsuit against the USDA. </p>\n<p>The federal government, by way of the Department of Agriculture, conducts regular, unannounced inspections of facilities where animals are kept by breeders, dealers, handlers, researchers, and so on. These inspections, performed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (<a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">APHIS</a>), target facilities that are licensed by the USDA to carry out their specific function (such as breeding) or are applying for such a license from the USDA. </p>\n<p>In February 2017, APHIS announced in a <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2017/sa-02/awa-hpa-compliance\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> that it had conducted a yearlong review of what it would publish online and due to privacy concerns would be removing and reviewing some materials, including inspection reports:</p>\n<blockquote><p>APHIS, during the past year, has conducted a comprehensive review of the information it posts on its website for the general public to view.  As a result of the comprehensive review, APHIS has implemented actions to remove certain personal information from documents it posts on APHIS’ website involving the Horse Protection Act and the Animal Welfare Act. </p>\n<p>Going forward, APHIS will remove from its website inspection reports, regulatory correspondence, research facility annual reports, and enforcement records that have not received final adjudication.  APHIS will also review and redact, as necessary, the lists of licensees and registrants under the AWA, as well as lists of designated qualified persons (DQPs) licensed by USDA-certified horse industry organizations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a subsequent revision to that press release, APHIS emphasized that this review had preceded the election and inauguration of Donald Trump, and that it was connected to an ongoing lawsuit:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2016, well before the change of Administration, APHIS decided to make adjustments to the posting of regulatory records. In addition, APHIS is currently involved in litigation concerning, among other issues, information posted on the agency’s website. While the agency is vigorously defending against this litigation, in an abundance of caution, the agency is taking additional measures to protect individual privacy.  These decisions are not final. </p></blockquote>\n<p>At the time, the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/02/09/usda-animal-welfare-records-purge-may-have-been-triggered-by-horse-industry-lawsuit/?utm_term=.22cbcf9ea2a7\" target=\"_blank\">speculated</a> that the legal action referenced here may have been a lawsuit brought by two Texas show horse owners against the USDA on due process and privacy grounds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>…Lee and Mike McGartland entered a horse named The Royal Dollar in the 74th annual Red Carpet Show of the South. A veterinary medical officer from the U.S. Department of Agriculture was there, too.</p>\n<p>The animal placed third in its class in the competition for Tennessee walking horses, which have a high-stepping gait that enthusiasts say comes from breeding and training. But it can also come from the application of caustic chemicals to a horse’s legs and other painful practices called “soring.” These are outlawed under the federal Horse Protection Act, and the Agriculture department is responsible for horse owners’ compliance. During a post-show inspection, the veterinary officer determined that The Royal Dollar was sore.</p>\n<p>The finding resulted in one of several official warnings between 2013 and 2016 that identified the McGartlands as “violators” — warnings that appeared on a public USDA database and that now underpin a legal battle between the Texas couple and the department. The McGartlands sued, arguing that the enforcement program denies due process to those accused of violations and breaks privacy laws by publishing personal information.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://ecf.txnd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?597614331856578-L_1_0-1\" target=\"_blank\">Records</a> from the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas show that the McGartlands filed the lawsuit in February 2016 and voluntarily withdrew it in February 2017 after the USDA began removing and reviewing inspection materials from the public APHIS database. </p>\n<p>Former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/02/09/usda-animal-welfare-records-purge-may-have-been-triggered-by-horse-industry-lawsuit/?utm_term=.9d0caf723678\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> the <em>Washington Post</em> that the review of publishing compliance reports had been tabled within the department towards the end of the Obama presidency and that litigation had been mentioned to him as a factor.  He didn’t sign off on the proposals, he said, because “there was not enough time for us to properly vet the recommendation, and I was concerned about transparency.”</p>\n<p>In any event, APHIS <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2017/sa-08/compliance-database\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> in August 2017 that it had restored the public search tool on its web site for inspection reports and compliance records. That search tool was online and <a href=\"https://acis.aphis.edc.usda.gov/ords/f?p=118:1:12035462388274\" target=\"_blank\">working</a> when we tested it on 9 March 2018, and APHIS inspection reports of animal breeders, carriers and handlers were publicly available.</p>\n<p>However, some of the reports did have some personal information redacted from them<strong> </strong>as a result of the review undertaken by the USDA. In particular, privacy concerns mean that smaller businesses sharing an address with the owner’s residence frequently have identifying details blacked out of inspection reports. This makes it difficult for animal rights activists, those involved in animal adoptions, and members of the public, to examine the inspection history of a specific breeder or dealer.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the USDA database no longer contains access to enforcement documents like warning letters, settlement agreements between the USDA and license holders, as well as orders and judgements handed down by administrative law judges. </p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Without access to full inspection reports and enforcement records, we cannot identify which breeders have violations and what action if any has been taken by the USDA as a result.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The major review conducted in 2017, the ASPCA told us, severely limits the public’s ability to find out basic information about particular USDA licensees, including dog breeders.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">According to a </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/SA_AWA/acis-table\" target=\"_blank\">chart</a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> published by the USDA, the effect of the web site review on inspection reports was that whereas previously, all inspection reports were posted with limited redactions, now APHIS publishes “inspection reports involving non-residential business entities with appropriate redactions to protect privacy interests of individuals (e.g. signatures)” and “inspection reports for individuals or businesses that are co-located with personal residences (homestead) with identifying information redacted to protect privacy interests.”</span></p>\n<p>Although these enforcement documents are no longer available via the USDA database, they continue to be <a href=\"https://www.oaljdecisions.dm.usda.gov/agriculture-decisions-publication\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> by the department’s Office of Administrative Law Judges, meaning that if the USDA takes enforcement proceedings against a breeder for a violation of the Animal Welfare Act, that information will be made public. </p>\n<p>However, access to that information is cumbersome. Instead of having the enforcement history of a named breeder or other license holder readily available in a comprehensive format, as part of a searchable database, a concerned member of the public would have to check the USDA’s Agriculture Decisions Publication every six months and search the document for mentions of specific license holders. </p>\n<p>Depending on whether that license holder conducts business from their home address, triggering privacy protections, the public may not then be able to examine the archive of inspection reports associated with that license holder. This makes it difficult for animal rights watchdogs, lawmakers, and members of the public to piece together a comprehensive picture of a USDA license holder’s overall inspection and enforcement history. </p>\n<p>We asked the USDA whether the review and temporary removal of inspection materials was linked to the McGartland lawsuit, but we have not yet received a response.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/animal-welfare/\">Animal Welfare</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/animals/\">animals</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/puppy-mills/\">puppy mills</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/usda/\">USDA</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/puppy-cute-sleeping-alone-cage-dog-717909709\" target=\"_blank\">PongMoji / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Contorno, Steve.  “Trump Blocks Access to Puppy Mill Inspections as Florida Weighs Dog Store Legislation.”<br>\n  <em>The Tampa Bay Times</em>.  6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.  “Updates to APHIS’ Website Involving Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act Compliance Information.”<br>\n  <em>United States Department of Agriculture</em>.  7 February 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Brulliard, Karen.  “USDA Removed Animal Welfare Reports From Its Site.

Photographer Lewis Morely, who captured the image, also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/sep/07/photography-lewis-morley-observer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identified</a> this man as the world renowned physicist. </p>\n<p>It wasn’t until <a href=\"https://archive.is/bBVVr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tariq Ali</a>, a political activist who truly is in this photograph, caught wind of the claim after Hawking’s death that the record was set <a href=\"http://archive.is/bBVVr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">straight</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>THE MAN IN THJE 1968 PIC IS NOT STEPHEN HAWKINGS</p>\n<p>Sad that Stephen Hawking has left us…he opposed the Vietnam war and the genocidal adventure in Iraq. BUT he is not in the 1968 demo pic. Repeat NOT. An illiterate caption by the National Portrait Gallery has created this myth. Wish it was him but it iosn’t so please no more emails on my FB regarding this…..</p></blockquote>\n<p>The National Portrait Gallery <a href=\"https://archive.is/2pZy1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acknowledged</a> the mistake and promised to correct their caption of the image: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Apologies and thanks for pointing this out. The individual was previously mistakenly identified as Stephen Hawking by the photographer. However, we have since discovered that this is incorrect. Our website will be updated by midnight tonight.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robert Newsom, a Vietnam protester who shared images of the event with the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/witness/march/17/newsid_4090000/4090886.stm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BBC</a> in 1968, noted that Tariq Ali and Vanessa Redgrave were headlining the march, but made no mention of Hawking’s alleged attendance:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was a 24-year-old American reading English at Cambridge and went down to London to participate and watch the anti-war protest that began in Trafalgar Square and moved on to the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square.</p>\n<p>Along the way I took the pictures, among others, of Tariq Ali and Vanessa Redgrave, who were heading the march. I was surprised that I was able so easily to approach and photograph the lead marchers.</p>\n<p>I remember being terrified at being chased down by what seemed like scores of mounted police with truncheons flailing about while the square was blocked off so that none who found themselves on the inside could get out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We couldn’t find a comparable image of Stephen Hawking from 1968. However, we’re skeptical that the theoretical physicist would have been physically able to march along with Ali during this Vietnam protest. Hawking suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and his physical abilities were already deteriorating in the late 1960s. According to the biography <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=0XoeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180&amp;dq=stephen+hawking+wheelchair&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjup666yOzZAhVK5IMKHVsQAxoQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=wheelchair&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stephen Hawking: A Life in Science</a>, </em>Hawking was having difficulty walking longer distances in 1968, and by the end of the decade he was using a wheelchair full time: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The 1960s ended with Hawking being forced to make a concession to his physical condition. After a great deal of persuasion from Jane and a number of close friends, he decided to abandon his crutches and take to a wheelchair. To those who had watched his gradual physical decline, this was seen as a major step and viewed with sadness. Hawking, however, refused to let it get him down. Although the acceptance of a wheelchair was a physical acknowledgement of his affliction, at the same time he gave it not the slightest emotional or mental endorsement. In every other way, life went on as usual. And he could not deny that it did enable him to get around more easily. Never giving in to the symptoms of ALS more than he is physically compelled to is all part of the Stephen Hawking approach to life.

Starting the Thursday before the Feast of the Kings, January 6th, and during six days, people from Riosucio join this traditionally Catholic religious fiesta in practice for over two hundred years to celebrate the arrival of the playful, “talkative” and mocking character of the Devil.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By contrast, the images, which date from <a href=\"http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-16500694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016</a> and were shot in a different part of the country, depict a “church” utterly devoid of parishioners. It was built by a self-styled Luciferian high priest and <em>brujo</em> (sorcerer) who does business under the assumed name Víctor Damián Rozo (his real name, according to a <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/victor-damian-rozo-gestor-del-templo-para-adorar-lucifer/457600-3&amp;prev=search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">profile</a> in the Colombian news magazine <em>Semana</em>, is Héctor Londoño Villegas). Rozo claims to have followers all over the world.</p>\n<p>He also claims to have built the church (officially dubbed the Luciferian Temple, Seeds of Light), so worshipers of Lucifer would have a place to congregate. In reality, there’s little evidence that the building, erected on Rozo’s own property, serves any other purpose than providing a backdrop for his self-promotional videos. Judging from his Twitter activity (under the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/damianrozo666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@damianrozo666</a>), Rozo’s primary enterprise is selling so-called “pacts with the devil,” the benefits of which include financial enrichment:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\">Como vender el alma al diablo¡ COMO HAGO UN PACTO CON EL DIABLO Y SATANAS: <a href=\"https://t.co/8ADZzkUShd\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/8ADZzkUShd</a> vía <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@YouTube</a></p>\n<p>— VICTOR DAMIAN ROZO (@damianrozo666) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/damianrozo666/status/973282260748263426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 12, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\nThere’s a catch, of course. In exchange for his services as a Luciferian deal-maker Rozo demands a percentage of his clients’ future incomes. It’s hard to determine how successful he has been at this scheme. Though he portrays himself as a globetrotting millionaire, the regional newspaper <em>Crónica del Quindío</em> <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-las_5_diabluras_del_luciferino_quindiano_vctor_damin_rozo-seccion-la_regin-nota-95430&amp;prev=search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">points out</a> that promotional photos of Rozo visiting exotic locales were created by digitally inserting his likeness into existing images.</p>\n<p>In short, although it does exist, Colombia’s controversial Church of Lucifer appears to be less a religious (or anti-religious) institution than the home base for a bizarre confidence scheme run by its owner, Víctor Damián Rozo. A reporter for <em>Vice Colombia</em> came to a similar conclusion after peeking behind the curtains of Rozo’s operation in 2017.

However, these posts are referring (inaccurately) to an incident that took place more than two years earlier, in August 2015, and the Tennessee school district referenced never banned the American flag to begin with.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the Dickson County School District temporarily ruled to not allow students to fly flags from their vehicles.

However, flags are not allowed to fly on school vehicles and cannot be worn as clothing, such as draped over a student like a cape.</p>\n<p>School officials arrived at the decision on the first day of school, Aug. 3.</p>\n<p>The nationwide Confederate flag-flying controversy erupted shortly after the June 17 shooting death of nine people in an African-American church in Charleston, S.C. The accused shooter, Dylann Roof, 21, posted several photos online posing with a handgun and the Confederate flag.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The school district’s decision stirred up considerable controversy at the time, as some media outlets reported that the school had <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/national/tennessee-school-district-bans-all-flags-including-american-flag/fDGHVEJkVF3u1lppN5xfoI/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned</a> American flags wholesale. However, as the school district has <a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/dickson/2015/08/27/dickson-co-schools-1700-word-reply-flag-controversy/32480471/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clarified</a> on numerous <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1015570105142942&amp;id=209409329092361\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">occasions</a>, it never banned flags from campuses, and this “rule” was an informal one relayed to students in an attempt to inform them about how to properly display the American flag.</p>\n<p>In a long <a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/dickson/2015/08/27/dickson-co-schools-1700-word-reply-flag-controversy/32480471/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explanation</a> published by the district in the wake of this controversy, officials explained that the American flag could be flown from vehicles if it was properly displayed, since it did not serve as a distraction. Furthermore, students would be allowed to bring flags to campus as long as it was done so respectfully:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As school started in Dickson County on August 3, it followed a summer of controversy and concern over symbols and questions that led our country to become divided, distracted, and disrupted. Student behaviors at one of our schools on the first day of school led to parent reports at the Central Office concerning such symbols being in the parking lot of our schools. This matter was appropriately addressed and expectations were communicated to our students in order to prevent distractions or disruptions to our learning environment. The school also took the opportunity to speak to students about proper respect and appropriate display of the American flag. A particular student behavior that was addressed included flags being brought to sporting events by students and used in a manner which was not respectful. The behavior included wearing the American flag around the waist and or tying it around the neck to wear as a cape. At this same time the ROTC instructors who teach color guard, flag etiquette and flag protocol have suggested that vehicles in a parade must follow a certain protocol if they choose to post a flag on the vehicle. It is also suggested that it may not be appropriate to post a flag in a vehicle while moving at 55 mph. According to our ROTC instructors there are some veterans who would be offended the American Flag would be treated in such a manner.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>The truth of the matter is the American flag flies in Dickson County at every school and district building, the Pledge of Allegiance is recited daily, and our students are being taught proper respect and appropriate display of the American flag. We want to ensure our parents and students that we are looking to only address student behaviors that distract, disrupt, or divide our mission of education. While we may not agree on how appropriate it may be to display an American flag behind a moving vehicle, this action does not distract, disrupt or divide. In fact it may assist us in unifying students toward our mission of academic success; therefore, we will not look to address issues involving the American flag any further. In addition the dress code may define what is to be worn on shirts, but beyond this requirement there are no restrictions on students bringing the American flag on campus.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This controversy is not just inaccurate, but also outdated. </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/large-american-flag-waving-stormy-sky-1029663487\" target=\"_blank\">Gooding Green / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">14 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Henderson, Nia-Malika.   “Inside the Battle Over the Confederate flag.”<br>\n    <em>CNN</em>.   24 June 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>McCrummen, Stephanie.   “Confederate Flag Comes Down on South Carolina’s Statehouse Grounds.”<br>\n    <em>Washington Post</em>.   10 July 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>My Fox Memphis</em>.   “Tennessee School District Bans All Flags, Including American Flag.”<br>\n    23 August 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>The Daily Herald</em>.   “Dickson County Schools Clear up Flag Controversy.”<br>\n    25 August 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dickson Country School District.   “Dickson Co Schools’ 1,700-Word Reply to Flag Controversy.”<br>\n    27 August 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "318"},

Waiting for them in deeper waters nearby was a United States Coast Guard Cutter named the <i>Itasca</i>, which was there to provide navigational support for what was intended to be Earhart’s most risky refuel in the middle of the ocean.</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<p>In a mystery that continues to provoke impassioned debate to this day, Earhart never arrived at Howland Island, and the wreckage of her plane, and the remains of both Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan have never conclusively been located, despite a large-scale <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/305240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a> in the area of Howland Island by the <i>Itasca</i> and others in the weeks following her disappearance. Earhart was declared dead in absentia two years later.</p>\n<p><b>Howland or Nikumaroro Island?</b></p>\n<p>The most straightforward and, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2012/03/23/opinion/butler-amelia-earhart/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">many experts</span></a>, most likely explanation for her death is that Earhart ran out of fuel during an ultimately unsuccessful search for Howland Island. Fuel analysis performed by <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Gc1-98NLfEYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Amelia+Earhart:+The+Mystery+Solved&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia6MbjyOzZAhXjxYMKHTrtD14Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Amelia%20Earhart%3A%20The%20Mystery%20Solved&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">historians</a> and scientists suggest that Earhart probably would have had very little extra fuel in the event of navigational problems by the time she was to have arrived at Howland Island, and the few radio transmissions between the Itasca and Earhart that went through suggest she was approaching its general location, as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/will-search-for-amelia-earhart-ever-end-180953646/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a> by <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Itasca’s operators heard her transmissions, growing stronger as she approached Howland Island shortly after sunrise. At one point her signal was so strong the ship’s radio operator ran to the deck to look for her overhead. But he saw only empty sky, and she, it seems, just clouds and empty ocean. Near the end, her voice was becoming strained; she sounded “frantic,” according to the Itasca’s commanding officer. “We must be on you but cannot see you,” she radioed. “Gas is running low.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Competing theories with varying degrees of plausibility (some of which, such as her being captured and held by the Japanese as a POW, are already conclusively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/11/blogger-discredits-claim-amelia-earhart-was-taken-prisoner-by-japan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debunked</a>) have been offered ever since.</p>\n<p>One group in particular has been remarkably successful in promoting their own theory of the incident to the mystery-loving public — The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), led by aviation accident investigator Ric Gillespie. The group is single-handedly <a href=\"http://archive.is/44o3L\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">responsible</a> <a href=\"http://archive.is/poOKu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">for</a> the <a href=\"http://archive.is/il2Bw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bulk</a> of <a href=\"http://archive.is/HQTdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">viral</a> <a href=\"http://archive.is/DXcLJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amelia</a> <a href=\"http://archive.is/il2Bw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Earhart</a> <a href=\"http://archive.is/BP7hf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">headlines</a> over the past decade.</p>\n<p>TIGHAR’s hypothesis rests on the assumption that bones recovered from an island about 350 nautical miles <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Nikumaroro+Island,+Kiribati/Howland+Island,+United+States+Minor+Outlying+Islands/@-1.9318164,-177.8135459,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x706aec9cb3d9ad87:0xb09d9ed73197d6a2!2m2!1d-174.5195974!2d-4.6779191!1m5!1m1!1s0x71baa54502b78235:0x46854f10a95ce0b9!2m2!1d-176.6182736!2d0.8113219\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">south</a> of Howland named Nikumaroro Island (but known at the time as Gardner Island), belong to Earhart. Throughout the years, a steady stream of artifacts found by TIGHAR and potentially associated with those human remains on the island have provided tantalizing suggestions for people invested in the theory that Earhart ended up somewhere else on land.</p>\n<p>Two of the main hurdles undermining widespread support for the TIGHAR explanation, however, are the fact that bones found on this island — discovered around 1940 — were originally described by a medical investigator as belonging to a stocky Polynesian male (not a tallish slim female of European descent like Earhart), and that nobody knows, presently, where the <a href=\"http://journals.upress.ufl.edu/fa/article/view/525\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nikumaroro Bones</a> are.</p>\n<p>This means that everyone and anyone discussing those bones is relying on the same 1941 notes of two doctors’ examination of the find to make arguments about who they may belong to. This context is important when considering the most recent <a href=\"http://archive.is/scCuZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">headlines</a> inspired by TIGHAR’s work, such as this from the <em>Daily Mail</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Is this the final resting place of Amelia Earhart? Bones discovered on Pacific island are ‘99% certain to be hers’ says scientist.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>The Nikumaroro Bones </b></p>\n<p>In early 1940, a local on the island of Nikumaroro came <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2016/11/02/the-mysterious-disappearance-of-amelia-earharts-skeleton/#1b1d44daba9f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">across</a> a skull and a bottle. By September 1940, word of the find had made its way to Gerald “Irish” Gallagher, the first officer-in-charge of the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme — a <a href=\"http://www.phoenixislands.org/history.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">failed</a> British effort to colonize a series of largely uninhabited islands, including that of Nikumaroro, where he was stationed. Gallagher sent a telegram to his superiors regarding the find, suggesting that they could be the bones of Amelia Earhart and that they should keep the find quiet.</p>\n<p>Gallagher noted in this <a href=\"https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bones_Chronology.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">telegram</a> that additional bones had been located, along with a women’s size 10 shoe and a sextant box. After a prolonged back and forth between British officials, the bones were shipped to Suva, Fiji and analyzed by two individuals — Lindsay Isaac and D.W. Hoodless.</p>\n<p>Isaac, a British medical officer, performed the first inspection on route to Fiji in the port of Tarawa on 11 February 1941. Following his analysis, Isaac sent Gallagher a telegram informing him that it was his view that the bones likely belonged to an elderly man of Polynesian descent — information that Gallagher <a href=\"https://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/13_1/tarawa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a> as anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>Hoodless, the principal of the Central Medical School in Suva, Fiji, performed a second inspection. Much of our information about the Nikumaroro Bones comes from a 4 April 1941 <a href=\"https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Bones_Chronology5.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> from Hoodless to an officer of the British Western Pacific Territories. Hoodless, using an analysis of the bone’s lengths, concluded that the bones likely belonged to a 45- to 55-year-old male with a height of around five and a half feet. Hoodless speculated the bones could have belonged either a Polynesian or a European person; he could not be sure.</p>\n<p>As a result of these conclusions, the bones (which were lost after Hoodless’ analysis) were largely forgotten until 1998, when TIGHAR-associated researchers <a href=\"https://tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/1998Vol_14/bonesandshoes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">presented</a> their theory at a meeting of the American Anthropological Association that the bones had been described incorrectly by Hoodless. The conclusion, made by forensic anthropologists Karen Burns and Richard Jantz using a reinterpretation of the information contained in the telegram, was that the bones could actually have belonged to someone who fits the Amelia Earhart profile:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Based on the information now in hand, [forensic anthropologists Richard] Jantz and [Karen] Burns both concluded that the remains found on Nikumaroro in 1939-40 represented an individual who was: (1) More likely female than male (2) More likely white than Polynesian or other Pacific Islander (3) Most likely between 5’5″ and 5’9″ in height.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This finding, which remains <a href=\"https://bradscholars.brad.ac.uk/bitstream/10454/7286/1/cross_nikumaroro_bones_journal_of_archaeological_sciences.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">controversial</span></a>, renewed interest in the Nikumaroro theory and has been the basis for numerous expeditions to the island to search for other artifacts that could bolster their interpretation. The group has gained exposure through press releases and from documentary film crews from media outlets that support their work.</p>\n<p>The 2018 paper that generated the viral claims that a scientist is “99% certain” that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to Earhart was written by Jantz, an author of the original 1998 paper. His 2018 paper is primarily a response to a <a href=\"https://bradscholars.brad.ac.uk/bitstream/10454/7286/1/cross_nikumaroro_bones_journal_of_archaeological_sciences.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2015 critique</a> of their work which argued that their reasons for questioning the 1941 analysis of the bones were insufficient.</p>\n<p><b>Scientists are “99% Certain” the Nikumaroro Bones Belong to Earhart</b></p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"http://journals.upress.ufl.edu/fa/article/view/525\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2018 paper</a>, which like many of their finds came with a TIGHAR <a href=\"http://archive.is/RKT9s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release</a> describing the find as essentially conclusive, Jantz reiterated his argument from the 1998 presentation that Hoodless could not (and did not) adequately analyze the bones. In this most recent paper, Jantz appears even more confident than his 1998 presentation, arguing that modern methods produce results that suggest a 99 percent certainty that the bones belonged to Earhart:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When Hoodless conducted his analysis, forensic osteology was not yet a well-developed discipline. Evaluating his methods with reference to modern data and methods suggests that they were inadequate to his task; this is particularly the case with his sexing method. Therefore his sex assessment of the Nikumaroro bones cannot be assumed to be correct.</p>\n<p>To address the question of whether the Nikumaroro bones match estimates of Amelia Earhart’s bone lengths, I compare Earhart’s bone lengths with the Nikumaroro bones using Mahalanobis distance. This analysis reveals that Earhart is more similar to the Nikumaroro bones than 99% of individuals in a large reference sample. This strongly supports the conclusion that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to Amelia Earhart.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That nearly-complete certainty refers specifically to the kind of analysis Jantz performed, in which he compared the dimensions of the Nikumaroro bones to a pool of data which contained a random assortment of 2776 Euro-American individual’s skeletal measurements. “If the bones do not belong to Amelia Earhart,” he <a href=\"http://journals.upress.ufl.edu/fa/article/view/525\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, “then they are from someone very similar to her. And, as we have seen, a random individual has a very low probability of possessing that degree of similarity.”</p>\n<p>He reviewed photos of Amelia Earhart that allowed for estimates of the actual length of Earhart’s skeletal features, and he reviewed the methods employed by Hoodless, suggesting they were out of date and not a reasonable basis for Hoodless’s conclusions about them. His analysis determined that Amelia Earhart is a better fit for the Nikumaroro Bones than 99 percent of the 2776 individuals contained in his dataset of Euro-American skeletal measurements. In an e-mail, Jantz told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It comes down to the fact the Earhart’s measurements are more similar to the [Nikumaroro] bones than 99% of the general population, as defined by my reference sample of Euro-Americans.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other forensic anthropologists believe Jantz’s methods make sense. In an e-mail, <a href=\"https://anthropology.arizona.edu/user/bruce-anderson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bruce Anderson</a>, an adjunct professor of forensic anthropology at the University of Arizona who also works for the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, described Jantz as “the pre-eminent physical/forensic anthropologist in the US in terms of measurements of the human body,” adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sex assessment from skeletal remains is one, if not the most common, error that has been routinely made by non-physical/forensic anthropologists. […] If I were a betting man, I’d put my money on the interpretation forwarded by Richard Jantz.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kristina Killgrove, a biological anthropologist at the University of West Florida, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zk7Yrkj2rk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> the BBC the methods are an interesting solution to a hard scientific problem, but that the certainty of the findings has been oversold:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr. Jantz has done a great job with the information at hand, in an attempt to go further in solving this case. But I disagree with the conclusion that we should necessarily assume that these bones are Earhart’s. […]</p>\n<p>I think that he has tried to correlate these measurements very well, which is an interesting approach, but to me it’s a lot of what-iffing. It’s essentially gaming out the logical conclusion of a whole lot of different variables. So this isn’t a positive identification as Jantz notes as well in his article.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Jantz’s work may suggest a higher similarity between the Nikumaroro Bones and Earhart’s dimensions than was previously assumed, it does not explain away any of the other significant challenges to the Nikumaroro hypothesis. Jantz acknowledged that there was a limit on how much information the 1941 notes could tell a researcher, but that he hoped his research would demonstrate that there are still avenues available to scientists hoping to shed light on the mystery:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What I hope my paper does is show that scientific methods can be used to examine this mystery. I understand there is only so much that can be done with the meager evidence left by Dr. Hoodless, but more can be done, and I hope will be.</p>\n<p>No one knows whether the bones will ever be found. If so, the matter could be put to rest in short order. If not, then we should bring as much evidence to<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>bear on the question as we possibly can.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Problems with the Nikumaroro Conclusion</b></p>\n<p>The TIGHAR <a href=\"http://archive.is/gt3lK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hypothesis</a> provides few specifics on how Earhart would have ended up 400 miles south of her intended target. A common <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Gc1-98NLfEYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Amelia+Earhart:+The+Mystery+Solved&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia6MbjyOzZAhXjxYMKHTrtD14Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Amelia%20Earhart%3A%20The%20Mystery%20Solved&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">approach</a> for aviation navigators during this era, in the event that they were unable to get a visual on the island (which was the case), or to receive their bearing from the <em>Itasca</em> (which was also the case), is to intentionally fly toward the north or south of the the expected target before flying a north-south line that would presumably intersect with the target.</p>\n<p>Historians on all sides of the debate generally agree that Earhart was likely trying to communicate this plan in the final undisputed transmissions received by the Itasca between 8:43 and 8:55 A.M., in which she stated, “We are on the line 157 337” (a compass bearing) and then a garbled transmission that many have <a href=\"https://www.tighar.org/Publications/TTracks/12_2/logjam.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">interpreted</span></a> as “we are running on line north and south.”</p>\n<p>In TIGHAR’s view, Earhart would have been south of the island, attempting to find it by going northward briefly, before pointing south, hoping that they would find Howland, but committed to south because their 157 337 line could, in a worst case scenario, intersect with either Baker Island (a bit south of Howland) or the more distant Nikumaroro:</p>\n<blockquote><p>She knows that Howland Island is somewhere on this 157/337 line, close enough for the <i>Itasca</i> to hear her radio calls, but that could be several hundred miles. What to do now? Turn left? Turn right? By happy coincidence, Howland is not the only island on the 157/337 line. […]</p>\n<p>Of course, the island they want to reach, and hope to reach, is Howland – the only place in the entire Central Pacific where there is an airfield – but the fate to be avoided at all costs is running out of gas over the open ocean.</p>\n<p>The most reasonable course of action is obvious: fly northwestward (337°) along the line for a short way to see if Howland is nearby in that direction. If it is not, turn around and proceed southeastward (157°) until you come to an island.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Critics of the theory, like science writer and Skeptoid podcast host Brian Dunning, <a href=\"https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4580\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">argue</a> that 1.) the clear radio transmissions received by the <em>Itasca</em> make it apparent she was quite close to Howland and 2.) that if she was close to Howland she would not have had anywhere near enough fuel to make it to Nikumaroro.</p>\n<p>Earhart had a 50 W radio <a href=\"https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Research/ResearchPapers/ElectraRadios/ElectraRadios.htm#4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transmitter</a> and utilized the 3105 khz HF radio frequency to communicate <a href=\"https://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Documents/Logs/ItascaRadioLog1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voice messages</a> to the Itasca. The distance such a signal could travel varies based on large number of variables including time of day, weather, altitude, atmospheric conditions, and even celestial factors. The clearest transmission received by the <em>Itasca</em> came in at 7:42 A.M., and it stated Earhart’s belief she was where she expected the island to be: “We must be on you but cannot see you but gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1000 feet.”</p>\n<p>Her voice at this point was quite clear, <a href=\"https://www.chasingearhart.com/single-post/2017/12/02/KHAQQ-Calling-Itasca-A-Conversation-with-Leo-Bellarts-Part-One\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according</a> to the <em>Itasca</em>’s chief radioman Leo G. Bellarts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We could hear her voice just as easy as I’m hearing yours right now and I’m deaf in one ear now. But I’ll tell you, you could hear her voice all over the shack and even outside the shack. You know, real loud and clear.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/theodore-s-rappaport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Theodore Rappaport</a> is an expert in wireless communication and an engineering professor at New York University and is also an active amateur radio operator who communicates around the world using high frequencies (HF) close to those used by Earhart. He told us: “It is possible that her transmission could have traveled for 1,000 to 2,000 miles or even more into darkness, or along the sunlight/darkness boundary, but the distance into the daylight direction would have been much smaller, on the order of 100-200 miles.” If she was transmitting using <a href=\"http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/am-amplitude-modulation/what-is-am-tutorial.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voice modulation</a>, he says, the distances would be only slightly smaller than if she was transmitting Morse code.</p>\n<p>This would suggest she was within 200 miles, probably closer, to Howland when their gas was “running low.” Indeed, the Coast Guard <a href=\"http://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2012/07/itasca-the-search-for-amelia-earhart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assumed</a> based on their radio communication with her that she went down in a sector between 40 miles and 200 miles from Howland Island.</p>\n<p>Given the 7:42 A.M. time of her clearest transmission, however, it is <i>possible</i> that these transmissions could have traveled further, thanks to some funky day-night interactions in the ionosphere that can — under certain circumstances — happen along the “<a href=\"http://www.robkalmeijer.nl/techniek/electronica/radiotechniek/hambladen/qst/1992/11/page80/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grey line</a>” between night and day. “Shortwave radio communications for 400 miles on a path either north or south of her plane could be doable at that time of day,” Rappaport told us.</p>\n<p>Putting Earhart more than 200 miles south of Howland would be a huge error for two experienced aviators, and it runs <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/305240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contrary</a> to the initial Coast Guard/Navy assumption she went down north west of the island. If she was that far off course, however, you would then have to argue they had enough fuel to make it close to Nikumaroro. TIGHAR suggests that she would have had hours of fuel (contrary to Earhart’s 7:42 A.M. statement of running low) after abandoning their hypothesized northward search for Howland.</p>\n<p>Marie K. and Elgen Long, in their famous <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Gc1-98NLfEYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Amelia+Earhart:+The+Mystery+Solved&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia6MbjyOzZAhXjxYMKHTrtD14Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Amelia%20Earhart%3A%20The%20Mystery%20Solved&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">book</a><i> Amelia Earhart: The Mystery Solved</i>, argued — based on a number of technical factors — that such a scenario would be unlikely, as they would have been perilously low on fuel once they arrived at what they felt was their intended target based on their reconstruction of her flight (a scenario that TIGHAR disputes). And then, there are those supporting artifacts collected near the Nikumaroro Bones and by later TIGHAR expeditions. Despite numerous proclamations of certainty regarding their link to Earhart, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2012/03/23/opinion/butler-amelia-earhart/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many</a> of the finds have later been called into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/30/amelia-earhart-plane-finally-found-not-so-fast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">question</a>. The island itself sits near currents that would likely transport trash and other artifacts to the island, and there is evidence of earlier habitation in the region. Additionally, a shipwreck occurred there on 29 November 1929 in which eleven <a href=\"https://tighar.org/wiki/File:Argus_(Melbourne,_Vic)_Thurs_5_Dec_1929,_p_7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">people</a> died.</p>\n<p>The bones themselves, in addition to being described as belonging to a short male, were assumed by Isaac in 1941 to be so weathered as to have been exposed for 20 years (long before Earhart’s disappearance), an assertion that cannot be addressed or challenged by modern techniques without the bones <a href=\"https://bradscholars.brad.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10454/7286/cross_nikumaroro_bones_journal_of_archaeological_sciences.pdf?sequence=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">themselves</a>.</p>\n<p>A lot of variables would have to line up all at once for the TIGHAR hypothesis to work with the Coast Guard/Navy data, and it also bears mentioning that Naval aircraft searched Nikumaroro island for Earhart and Noonan on July 9th and found no signs of Earhart, her plane, or Noonan.</p>\n<p>Due to these complicating factors, Jerry Adler <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/will-search-for-amelia-earhart-ever-end-180953646/?page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">argued</a> in <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i> that Earhart running out of fuel near Howland “remains the simplest explanation, but for that very reason, has attracted derision from those who prefer their history complicated.”</p>\n<p>The historical record provides far less conclusive evidence than TIGHAR suggests, and arguing that notes provided by a deceased doctor about bones lost since 1941 offer 99 percent certainty is something of an oversell.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we rank the claim as unproven. We don’t expect that to change any time soon, either.</p>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Correction [15 March 2018]: The dataset used by Richard Jantz for comparison purposes included the measurements of 2776 individuals.

light of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProPublica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@ProPublica</a>‘s reporting this week on use of the presidential seal for commercial purposes, that the Trump Tower gift shop has been selling various tchotchkes bearing the presidential seal. <a href=\"https://t.co/mQYqdgLmbm\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/mQYqdgLmbm</a></p>\n<p>— Steve Reilly (@BySteveReilly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BySteveReilly/status/971164396444684288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 6, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>These tees and tchotchkes came under scrutiny because a federal <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/713?qt-us_code_temp_noupdates=0#qt-us_code_temp_noupdates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statute</a> prohibits certain uses of the presidential seal:</p>\n<blockquote><p>18 U.S. Code § 713</p>\n<p>(a) Whoever knowingly displays any printed or other likeness of the great seal of the United States, or of the seals of the President or the Vice President of the United States, or the seal of the United States Senate, or the seal of the United States House of Representatives, or the seal of the United States Congress, or any facsimile thereof, in, or in connection with, any advertisement, poster, circular, book, pamphlet, or other publication, public meeting, play, motion picture, telecast, or other production, or on any building, monument, or stationery, for the purpose of conveying, or in a manner reasonably calculated to convey, a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States or by any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.</p></blockquote>\n<p>ProPublica cited legal experts who suggested that the Trump Organization’s commercial appropriation of the seal for marketing or branding purposes falls outside what would be considered acceptable use under the law:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ethics experts have long been on the lookout for signs that the Trump Organization would exploit the office of the presidency for commercial gain. Several said that using the presidential seal on the company’s golf courses would fall into this category.</p>\n<p>A law governs the manufacture or use of the seal, its likeness, “or any facsimile thereof” for anything other than official U.S. government business. It can be a criminal offense punishable by up to six months in prison.</p>\n<p>The “law is an expression of the idea that the government and government authority should not be used for private purpose,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University specializing in government and legal ethics said. “It would be a misuse of government authority.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the wake of the ProPublica story, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization <a href=\"https://apnews.com/0dc5c9ad40f645ea805827b75955eb0b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> Associated Press that the tees were a gift from golf club members:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The plaques were presented to the club by a small group of members, who are incredible fans of the president, in honor of Presidents’ Day weekend,” said Trump Organization spokeswoman Amanda Miller. “They were temporary and have since been removed.”</p>\n<p>The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for clarification on who ordered the plaques, the names of the members who “presented” them, how they were displayed and at what club.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But reporters from ProPublica and WNYC <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-extra-the-trump-organization-ordered-golf-course-markers-with-the-presidential-seal-that-may-be-illegal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> they had examined the order form, which listed the purchaser as Trump International. Reportedly, Eagle Sign &amp; Design has done other work for Trump International in the past.</p>\n<p>Despite the Trump Organization’s claim that the replicas were temporary and had been removed, the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington (CREW) issued a statement <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-org-removes-presidential-seals-claims-illegal-article-1.3859514\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saying</a> they had nevertheless violated the law:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There does not appear to be any legal interpretation that says it’s okay to violate the law if it’s only for a holiday weekend. If anything, it raises more questions as to whether they knew they were violating the law, so intentionally tried to do it for a short time to see if it would get noticed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Previous presidents, including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan, had items such as golf balls and sets of China made that featured the presidential seal, but they were for personal use or to give out as gifts, not commercial marketing.</p>\n<p>Still, legal experts weren’t unanimous in the opinion that the Trump Organization’s use of the seal was against the law. Yale law professor Stephen L. Carter wrote that although the commercial appropriation of the symbol can be criticized as “tacky,” it doesn’t rise to the level of a crime:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The statute regulating (not “barring” or “prohibiting”) use of the presidential seal is drafted with care. Under Section 713, one commits a crime only by displaying the seal “in a manner reasonably calculated to convey, a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States or by any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof.” This language, borrowed from the law of unfair competition, is narrowly drafted to avoid trampling on First Amendment rights. Displaying a likeness of the seal is prohibited only when the use will create that “false impression of sponsorship or approval” — what courts in other contexts call “confusion as to source.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The federal statute is constitutional only so long as we read it to ban uses of the seal that are either deceptive or misleading, and nothing else,” Carter observed, noting that any number of items bearing the seal can be purchased (and legally so) on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=presidential+seal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon.com</a>. “What the Trump Organization is doing, or what Amazon is doing, or what a publisher touting a book is doing, involves uses that are neither deceptive nor misleading.”</p>\n<p>The extent to which expert opinions differ on this is probably best reflected in the fact that Trump International announced the removal of the markers within days of their legality being questioned.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">8 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Carter, Stephen L.  “Is Using the Presidential Seal on Trump Merchandise Criminal or Just Tacky?<br>\n  <em>The Washington Post</em>.  7 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Condon, Bernard.  “Trump Org: Presidential Seals at Golf Club Came from Members.”<br>\n  <em>Associated Press</em>.  6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Moore, Mark.  “Trump International Ordered Golf Course Markers with Presidential Seal.”<br>\n  <em>New York Post</em>.  5 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sommerfeldt, Chris.  “Trump Organization Removes Presidential Seal Replicas Amid Complaints that They Could Be Illegal.”<br>\n  <em>New York Daily News</em>.  6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sullivan, Katherine.  “The Trump Organization Ordered Gold Course Markers with the Presidential Seal.

Online chat revealed that members of the gang, who lived across the UK, would offer advice and guidance to others on drugging their young victims.</p>\n<p>Seven men, aged between 30 and 51 and including three convicted sex offenders, were brought to justice following an investigation led by the National Crime Agency.</p>\n<p>The details can be reported in full for the first time after the trial of two of them, John Denham, 49, and Matthew Stansfield, 34, concluded at Bristol crown court with their convictions. Denham was found guilty of conspiracy to sexually assault a child under 13. Stansfield was convicted of two charges of conspiracy to rape a child under 13.</p>\n<p>The others – Robin Hollyson, 30; Christopher Knight, 35; Adam Toms, 33; David Harsley, 51, and Matthew Lisk, 32 – pleaded guilty earlier to the charges they faced.</p>\n<p>Hollyson, who was previously known as Robin Fallick, Stansfield and Harsley are convicted sex offenders while Denham, who changed his name from Benjamin Harrop, was a respected youth football coach.</p>\n<p>In total they faced more than 30 charges, including the rape of a child, conspiracy to rape a child, sexual activity with a child and administering a substance with intent against three victims – a baby, a toddler and a pre-school-age child. Investigators, who spoke before the verdicts, believe there are other victims.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to other news reports, some of King’s fellow inmates admitted to plotting to do him physical harm at the facility where they were imprisoned:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nPrisoner John Denham told an inquest that fellow inmates at HMP Bristol quickly took out contracts on King to burn him or give him a “black eye or two”.</p>\n<p>King’s mother Deborah Wyatt added that a fellow gang member had been “sugared” – burned with sugar-filled water – in an attack he feared was intended for him.</p>\n<p>In a statement to police, Denham said people had taken contracts out on King inside prison to hurt him.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, the most salacious element of Neon Nettle’s reporting, that James King was “found dead in his prison cell with his penis chopped off,” was entirely fabricated by that web site.  </p>\n<p>In fact, King was found hanging unconscious in his cell (and died of his injuries two days later), after which an inquest heard medical and other forms of evidence sufficient to support a conclusion of suicide.  No legitimate news reporting stated that King had been murdered by other inmates or found with his penis “chopped off”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nJust four months into his sentence he was found hanging in his cell and died two days later in hospital on January 17.</p>\n<p>A four-day inquest before a jury at Flax Bourton, near Bristol, heard how King had anxiety and depression, which got worse around the time of his sentencing.</p>\n<p>He had tried to kill himself before arriving at Bristol prison and was three times placed on special observation amid fears he would harm himself or commit suicide.</p>\n<p>Prison officer Mike Simmonds said there was “a lot of suspicion” because his cellmate Cona Ellis was found covered in blood and wearing King’s watch.</p>\n<p>But when forensic officers examined the cell and found two suicide notes police decided there was “no foul play”, it was said.</p>\n<p>Pathologist Amanda Jeffery said King died as a result of lack of oxygen to the brain caused by hanging.</p>\n<p>After more than four hours of deliberation the jury of ten people returned a conclusion of suicide.<br></p></blockquote>\n<p>None of this misreporting was surprising, as <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/?s=%22neon+nettle%22\" target=\"nn\">Neon Nettle</a> is a fake news site particularly known for publishing fabricated and exaggerated clickbait stories about pedophiles.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/\" class=\"author-link\">David Mikkelson</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>The Guardian</em>.   “Revealed: Child Sex Abuse Gang ‘With Tentacles That Go Round the World.’<br>\n    22 April 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Newton, Daniel.   “Pedophile Who Raped Baby Found Dead in Cell with Penis Chopped Off.”<br>\n    <em>Neon Nettle</em>.   8 November 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Daily Express</em>.   “Paedophile Baby Rapist Found Dead in His Cell After Inmates Took Contracts Out on Him.”<br>\n    27 November 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mortimer, Caroline.   “Notorious Paedophile Killed Himself After Inmates Took Out ‘Contracts’ on Him, Inquest Hears.”<br>\n    <em>The Independent</em>.   27 November 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "254"},

A <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list</a> of Presidential actions (including executive orders) available on the White House’s web site shows that no executive order at all, whether for veteran’s health care or anything else, was signed on this date. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">The language in this post seems to be referring to the </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/07/obama-veteran-affairs-hospitals-bill/13718905/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Veterans Choice Act</a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">, which was </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/07/obama-veteran-affairs-hospitals-bill/13718905/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signed</a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> into law by President Obama in August 2014.

The Program will operate for 3 years or until the Fund is exhausted. The Program will provide Veterans who were enrolled as of August 1, 2014 or eligible to enroll as a recently discharged combat Veteran with a Veterans Choice Card, and allow those Veterans who are unable to schedule an appointment within 30 days of their preferred date or the clinically appropriate date, or on the basis of their place of residence to elect to receive care from eligible non-VA health care entities or providers. This is separate from VA’s existing program providing Veterans care outside of the VA system. Eligible non-VA entities or providers must enter into agreements with VA to furnish care, must maintain the same or similar credentials and licenses as VA providers, and must submit to VA a copy of any medical records related to care and services provided under the Program for inclusion in the Veteran’s VA electronic medical record.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The VA <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/health/NewsFeatures/2017/July/Things-to-Know-About-the-Veteran-Choice-Program.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">elaborated</a> on the criteria that veterans must meet in order to seek treatment at outside providers. Even then, the choice of hospitals is limited to the facilities that have agreed to participate in the program. Furthermore, this bill does not include a provision stating that it covered all of the health care provided at these facilities. Some veterans may be <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/cost/copays.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eligible</a> for free health care services, but most are required to pay for a portion of their treatment:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color: #f4f4f3; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">While many Veterans qualify for free healthcare services based on a VA compensable service-connected condition or other special eligibilities, most Veterans are required to complete a financial assessment or means test at the time of enrollment to determine if they qualify for free health care services.

In his research, Lott found that between 2009 and 2015, the number of people killed in a mass shooting in the United States (in relation to the overall population) was lower than it was in several European countries, including Norway, France, Switzerland and Finland.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is that this is accurate based on the CPRC’s definition of a mass shooting, but also extremely misleading. It uses inappropriate statistical methods to obscure the reality that mass shootings are very rare in most countries, so that when they do happen they have an outsized statistical effect. Of the countries chosen by Lott for his analysis, the United States is by some distance the most consistent site of mass shootings.</p>\n<p><b>What is a mass shooting?</b></p>\n<p>Counting mass shootings is a notoriously difficult exercise. For one thing, there is no consensus on what counts as a mass shooting, and what doesn’t. The FBI, for example, <a href=\"https://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw2017/images/en_artwork/Fact_Sheets/2017NCVRW_MassShootings_508.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> a mass shooting as involving the murder of three people.  The pro-gun-control nonprofit group <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everytown for Gun Safety</a> defines a mass shooting as one in which <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/reports/mass-shootings-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">four people</a> are killed, not including the shooter. <em>Mother Jones</em>, which tracks mass shootings in the United States, defines the <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">phenomenon</a> as  “indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker.” The Mass Shootings in America <a href=\"http://library.stanford.edu/projects/mass-shootings-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">project</a>, run by Stanford University, defines a mass shooting as one involving three or more victims (not including the shooter) but is not limited to fatalities. </p>\n<p>These metrics also typically focus on gun violence that is not related to armed robberies or gang activity, and often exclude domestic “<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-22213942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">family annihilations</a>,” instead including only mass shootings that take place in public. They also typically include terrorism-related shootings, a factor that becomes especially important when comparing mass shootings in the United States with those in other countries.</p>\n<p>Lott, in his research, defines a mass shooting as involving “four or more people killed in a public place, and not in the course of committing another crime, and not involving struggles over sovereignty.”</p>\n<p>We will examine Lott’s claim on its own terms, while bearing in mind that the figures can shift depending on which definitions and criteria are used. </p>\n<p><strong>The CPRC analysis</strong></p>\n<p>From 2009 to 2015, there were 199 deaths from 25 mass shootings in the United States, according to Crime Prevention Research Center’s downloadable <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2018/03/Mass-Public-Shooting-cases-1998-to-2015-Public-1.xlsx\">data</a>. If we apply the CPRC criteria to other data sources (<em><a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/\" target=\"_blank\">Mother Jones</a> </em>and <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/documents/2017/03/appendix-mass-shootings-united-states-2009-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Everytown</a>), this number largely checks out, but there are instances where the difficulty of categorizing mass shootings becomes clear. </p>\n<p>For example, the CPRC did not include the 7 June 2013 killings of <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-monica-shooting-funeral-20130619-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">five people</a> in Santa Monica, California. John Zawahri shot and killed his father and brother at home, set the house on fire, then shot and killed three more people at Santa Monica College.</p>\n<p>Although Zawahri killed five people, only three were killed in public in the second part of a shooting spree that was only ended when police killed him outside the college’s library. This might appear to many observers to be a mass shooting in which the attacker killed five people, but it was left out of the CPRC analysis, apparently because two of the five fatal shootings took place in a private home. Conversely, the CPRC analysis did include a 20 February 2012 <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/business-dispute-gun-battle-eyed-norcross-shooting/eNxg6fRRc5MIcqE3SQyXLO/\" target=\"_blank\">incident</a> in which Jeon Soo Paek shot dead his two sisters and their two husbands at the spa they co-owned in Norcross, Georgia.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the public dimension of the Santa Monica shooting, all the victims in Norcross were relatives of the perpetrator, and all were killed at their family-owned place of business, reportedly after a dispute over money. However, Paek shot dead four people at a location that wasn’t a private home and — apparently on that basis — those deaths are included in the CPRC analysis. </p>\n<p>In any event, if we compare the number of mass shooting deaths for each year to the United States population for each year, we get an average annual death rate of 0.09 per million from 2009 to 2015 (almost exactly the 0.089 claimed by the CPRC.)</p>\n<p>This means that on average, between 2009 and 2015, there was one death per year from a mass shooting for every 11 million people living in the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Other countries</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-Wednesday-November-1-12.30-AM.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-131766\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-Wednesday-November-1-12.30-AM.png?w=700\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-Wednesday-November-1-12.30-AM.png?w=1394 1394w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-Wednesday-November-1-12.30-AM.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-Wednesday-November-1-12.30-AM.png?resize=768,320 768w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-Wednesday-November-1-12.30-AM.png?resize=1024,426 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1394px) 100vw, 1394px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The first thing to note about the rankings is that Lott has compared the mass shooting death rate in the United States with that of other countries <em>where there was a mass shooting</em> between 2009 and 2015. This might seem obvious, but it’s important to point out that very many countries did not see a single mass shooting as defined by Lott during this period. </p>\n<p>The second striking thing about the list of mass shootings in Europe is that it is dominated by outliers. Where the United States saw at least twelve mass shooting deaths every year between 2009 and 2015, some of the other countries on Lott’s list experienced one or two rare but very high-casualty shootings. When you average out the death rates, this creates a highly misleading impression about the consistency and lethality of mass shootings outside the United States. </p>\n<p>The example of Norway gives a good illustration of just how absurd this use of statistics is. In 2009 and 2010, according to Lott’s data, there were zero mass shooting deaths in Norway. In 2011, far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed eight people in a series of bombings in Oslo, then shot dead 69 more in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/world/europe/anders-behring-breivik-murder-trial.html\" target=\"_blank\">massacre</a> at a Labor Party summer camp on Utoya island. </p>\n<p>In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, there was not a single death from a mass shooting in Norway.</p>\n<p>If we compare the number of mass shooting deaths each year to the population of Norway each year, using the same method we did for the United States, we get an average annual death rate of 2 per million, more than 20 times higher than the rate in the United States (0.09 per million), even though we know there were zero mass shooting deaths in six out of those seven years, in Norway.</p>\n<p>If this strikes you as ridiculous, you’re on to something. </p>\n<p>In his analysis, Lott used the mean to calculate the average annual death rate from mass shootings, which is calculated by adding all the numbers in a set divided by the amount of numbers in the set. This is a problem in situations such as these, as it assigns equal value to all numbers. (The mean of a set of numbers is also referred to as its <a href=\"https://sciencing.com/difference-between-mean-average-6461324.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average</a>.) </p>\n<p>The median, which is the middle point in a list of values in which half the numbers are above and half are below, can give a far better sense of what is typical. </p>\n<p>If we apply the median to Norway’s annual death rate from mass shootings between 2009 and 2015, we mitigate against the enormous skewing effect of one of those years (2011), and get a much more realistic statistical picture of mass shootings in Norway. The median, in this case, is zero. That means that in a typical year between 2009 and 2015, nobody in Norway was killed in a mass shooting.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t tell the full story either, since we can’t erase the fact that 69 people were killed in a devastating attack in 2011. The more information we examine, the better our understanding. But what the median does provide, which the mean does not, is a sense of the <em>consistency</em> of deaths from mass shootings in a particular country, over a particular period of time.</p>\n<p>If we apply the same calculation to mass shooting deaths in the United States, we find that the median annual number of deaths per million people was 0.06 between 2009 and 2015, while the mean was 0.09. So stripping away the outliers (in this instance) means the picture was actually slightly better for the United States than the mean had suggested. </p>\n<p>We did all these calculations with the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-Wednesday-November-1-12.30-AM.png\">list</a> of mass shootings used by Lott in his analysis. In some cases the numbers differ from his, because we used each country’s population for each year rather than just using the 2015 population, which is an inappropriate benchmark when calculating a death rate over a period of seven years. </p>\n<p>These rankings are based only on Lott’s own data and the CPRC definition of a mass shooting (four people shot dead in public, excluding the assailant, in an act not related to crime or warfare.) Let’s see what happens to the rankings when we strip away the outlier events by using the median, and get a better picture of the typical consistency of mass shooting deaths from 2009 to 2015.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table style=\"height: 449px;\" width=\"700\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 346.667px;\"><strong>Average (mean) Annual Mass Shooting Death Rate, 2009-2015 (per million people)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 352.222px;\"><strong>Typical (median) Annual Mass Shooting Death Rate, 2009-2015 (per million people)</strong></td>\n</tr><tr><td style=\"width: 346.667px;\">1.

In the United States, there were at least 12 mass shooting deaths every single year. </p>\n<p>The CPRC ranking shared by Fox News mostly accurately presents the average annual death rate from mass shootings, as defined by the CPRC, between 2009 and 2015. However, those figures are actually highly misleading, and use a particular type of statistical average to create the false impression that mass shootings are less frequent and less deadly in the United States than in European countries. </p>\n<p>In reality, mass shootings are rare outside the United States — even in the sixteen countries listed by Lott where there was a mass shooting between 2009 and 2015, and even after accounting for population size. But on the rare occasions when mass shootings do take place in European countries, they give rise to a relatively high annual mass shooting death rate in those years because of the comparatively small populations of those countries. </p>\n<p>Between 2009 and 2015, the United States was the only country on that list where someone died every year in a mass shooting. Every other country had at least five out seven years without a death from a mass shooting. </p>\n<p>Finally, the death rate from mass shootings has significantly increased in the United States since Lott published his research in 2015. We applied the CPRC criteria to the frequently updated <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/\" target=\"_blank\">database</a> of mass shootings maintained by <em>Mother Jones</em>, and found that in 2016, there were 65 deaths in incidents that would be designated mass shootings under CPRC criteria, and in 2017 there were 94. Over the two years, that is an average annual death rate of 0.24 per million people, which is almost three times higher than the United States death rate between 2009 and 2015. </p>\n<p>In other words, things have become dramatically worse in the United States since the CPRC research was first published.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fox-news/\">fox news</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-control/\">gun control</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-crime/\">gun crime</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-rights/\">gun rights</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-violence/\">gun violence</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/mass-shootings/\">mass shootings</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan MacGuill</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Everytown for Gun Safety.  “Mass Shootings in the United States: 2009-2016.”<br>\n  <em>Everytown for Gun Safety</em>.  March 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Follman, Mark; Aronsen, Gavin; Pan, Deanna.  “A Guide to Mass Shootings in America.”<br>\n  <em>Mother Jones</em>.  21 July 2012</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Vander Brug, Brian; Stevens, Matt.  “Funeral Held For Father, Daughter Killed in Santa Monica Rampage.”<br>\n  <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.  19 June 2013.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Anderson, Joel.  “Business Dispute, La.

Her posting has also been reported in other media. The City does not publicly comment on specific personnel matters. In light of these assertions, however, it is important to note that the City of Roanoke respects the Constitutional rights of its citizens and that the dismissal in question was not based upon anyone’s exercise of such rights.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the office told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The City has no policy or procedure limiting the right of its employees to hold concealed carry permits as authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Durham herself told <em>The Roanoke Times</em> that her termination papers showed different <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/local/roanoke/former-social-services-employee-whose-claims-went-viral-intends-to/article_013f0e88-f120-5e5a-831a-8f35447b579f.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reasons</a> for her firing from the city, where she had worked for less than a year:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Four months ago, she said, her trainer taught her a procedure that she followed, but then was reprimanded for it by her supervisor. So she alerted her trainer, who sent her a “nasty email” calling her “sloppy and unprofessional.”</p>\n<p>Durham said she took the matter to her supervisor, who, along with the trainer, “threw her under the bus.”</p>\n<p>Later, Durham said, she was given a set of performance expectations that required her to close cases at a faster pace. She acknowledged it took her time to adjust to the caseload in Roanoke after coming from rural Craig County, but said she exceeded all expectations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, Durham said, she was told that it was actually because of her gun permit:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The next day, at about 4:30 p.m. Friday, she was summoned to the office of the assistant director of the department, was told she was being fired and given the document listing the reasons. At the top, she said, was a concern about “workplace safety.”</p>\n<p>Durham said she asked about it and was told by the assistant director that her possession of a concealed weapons permit made her a safety risk in the building and for co-workers.</p>\n<p>Three Roanoke police officers escorted her to her desk, Durham said, where her personal possessions were loaded onto a cart and pushed to her car by one of the officers while the two others escorted her out of the building.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We obtained a copy of the official police report in response to our request, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Goss advised that she has a conceal carry permit and believed that she usually has a weapon in her vehicle…. We arrived at 1547 hours. The call was reported on the 3rd floor (Social Services Department). Upon arrival to the 3rd floor we were escorted to one of the offices in the back where we met with Mr. Goss and another employee advising us they wanted us there because they didn’t know how Ms. Durham was going to react to the situation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On 13 March 2018, a copy of Storm Durham’s termination letter was <a href=\"https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/former-roanoke-social-services-employee-claims-she-was-fired-for-having-concealed-carry-permit?__vfz=rtw_top_pages%3D3106500007849\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared</a> by WSLS.com.

Hasta Muerta Coffee staff advised him that your establishment does not serve the Police. </p>\n<p>Obviously, this is both a surprise and a matter of concern for all Oakland Police Officers. Oakland Police Officers work tirelessly every day to serve the residents of our City. I have never heard of Police Officers being refused service by an Oakland business. Therefore, I write to you to clarify your business policy on serving, or indeed not serving, Oakland police officers. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Donelan also offered to meet in person with the owners of Hasta Muerta Coffee, but he told us that there had been no response from the café.</p>\n<p>The Hasta Muerte café is located on Fruitvale Avenue in Oakland, a mile north of the Fruitvale train station, where a transit police officer shot and killed <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/06/local/la-me-bart-cop-sentence-20101106\" target=\"_blank\">Oscar Grant</a> on New Year’s Day 2009.

He recently filed a lawsuit against a group of defendants that he believes are responsible for instigating the hateful crime spree.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This lawsuit was filed<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> by Larry Klayman in July 2016 in the United States District Court of the Northern District of Texas on behalf of himself and Dallas Police Sargent Demetrick Pennie, shortly after five police officers were </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/us/black-lives-matter-reaction.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">killed</a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> by a sniper. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">The </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/324251965/Pennie-v-Soros-et-al-Amended-Complaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> accused Obama and 16 other defendants of inciting “their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicity including but not limited to Jews, Christians and Caucasians.”  It was </span>dismissed in June 2017:</p>\n<blockquote><p>With respect to Defendants President Obama and General Holder, the court grants their Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 21), as Plaintiffs lack Article III standing, and accordingly dismisses without prejudice Count Three for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Counts One and Two are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i), as Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed these claims against President Obama and General Holder, and no answer or motion for summary judgment has been filed by either Defendant.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Klayman has a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits. In fact, during the back-and-fourth litigation of the aforementioned lawsuit, the court <a href=\"https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/3059js704/texas-northern-district-court/klayman-v-obama-et-al/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> Klayman about filing more “nonsensical documents” and threatened him with a fine:</p>\n<blockquote><p>ORDER: The record reflects Mr. Klayman’s predilection for filing frivolous, nonsensical, and vituperative documents, in the form of notices, motions, briefs, etc., in response to unfavorable rulings. The court has grown weary of Mr. Klayman’s tactics. If Mr. Klayman files any further frivolous or nonsensical documents in this matter, the court will personally sanction him monetarily. The court directs the Clerk to strike “Plaintiffs’ Response to the Court’s Order Denying Motion for Leave to File Notice of New Case Authority Re: Memorandum Opinion and Order in Nwanguma v. Trump”(Doc. 132 ). (Ordered by Judge Sam A Lindsay on 4/13/2017) (axm) (Entered: 04/14/2017)</p></blockquote>\n<p>It appears that Klayman escaped discipline during the course of these legal proceedings, but the conservative attorney has not always been so lucky. In a 2017 profile of the conservative attorney, TheHill.com<em> </em>noted that Klayman has been formally <a href=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/lobbyist-profiles/316986-a-crusader-for-justice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disciplined</a> by multiple courts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a 2016 opinion, a federal court of appeals noted 12 cases “in which Klayman’s ability to practice law in an ethical and orderly manner was called into question.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Klayman, an avid supporter of the “birther” conspiracy theory, also once filed a <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2014/10/07/prima-farcie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">petition</a> to get Obama deported. Klayman has also referred to Obama as a “Muslim king” and once held a “citizen’s grand jury” (which had no legal authority) in an attempt to charge Obama with fraud for becoming president. The activist lawyer’s documents have no force of law and compel no government action, serving instead as self-published expressions of his political viewpoint.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/barack-obama/\">barack obama</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/guerrilla-news/\">guerrilla.news</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/judicial-watch/\">judicial watch</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/larry-klayman/\">larry klayman</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/london-united-kingdom-26-july-2008-769729684\" target=\"_blank\">Alessia Pierdomenico / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Barbaro, Michael.   “Black Lives Mater Was Gaining Ground.

A few weeks later, on 1 March, he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/03/01/white-house-planning-major-announcement-thursday-on-steel-and-aluminum-imports/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports and a 25 percent tariff on steel.</p>\n<p>The latter had the unintended consequence of sparking a stock sell-off on Wall Street, reflecting investors’ fears of a looming international trade war and inflation. Predictably, the stock prices of American steel producers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-companies/u-s-steel-aluminum-stocks-up-on-trumps-tariffs-but-other-industries-fear-price-rises-idUSKCN1GD6FH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rose</a> in response to the tariff announcement. Those of auto makers and other businesses heavily dependent on foreign steel took a hit. </p>\n<p>One of the latter was the crane manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.manitowoccranes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manitowoc</a>, whose share price tumbled from $29.72 the day before the announcement to $26.93 the day after. That surprised no one, but something curious did happen over the few weeks just prior to Trump’s speech. According to a 2 March <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-ichan-steel-imports-cf7deb8beaf0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by progressive news site Think Progress, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a former economic regulatory adviser to Trump, sold off $31.3 million worth of Manitowoc stock:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Billionaire investor and longtime Trump confidant Carl Icahn dumped $31.3 million of stock in a company heavily dependent on steel last week, just days before Trump announced plans to impose steep tariffs on steel imports.</p>\n<p>In a little-noticed SEC <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/61986/000081376218000018/ntwsch13da04022218.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filing</a> submitted on February 22, 2018, Icahn disclosed that he systematically sold off nearly 1 million shares of Manitowoc Company Inc. Manitowoc is a “is a leading global manufacturer of cranes and lifting solutions” and, therefore, heavily dependent on steel to make its products.</p>\n<p>The filing came just seven days before a White House event where Trump announced his intention to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Without ever mentioning the phrase “insider trading,” the article’s author, Judd Legum, implied that such may have taken place, highlighting what he termed the “impeccable timing” of Icahn’s sell-off. Other sources, including the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>, and <em>Washington Post</em>, noted the timing as well. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-02/icahn-sold-down-stake-in-steel-linked-investment-before-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The billionaire investor sold more than a third of his stake in the Manitowoc, Wisconsin-based company, which has a sizable exposure to U.S. steel imports, from Feb. 12 through Feb. 22, according to a regulatory filing last Friday. Icahn remains Manitowoc’s fifth-largest holder with about 4.8 percent of the company’s common shares.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump started an investigation to determine the effect of steel and aluminum trading on the U.S. last April, citing national security concerns. The U.S. Commerce Department delivered its recommendations for steel to the president on Jan. 11 and for aluminum on Jan. 22. Both were made public on Feb. 16.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Though Trump and Icahn’s relationship stretches back many years and they’re sometimes described as “longtime friends” (Think Progress called Icahn a “confidant” of Trump’s), the <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carl-icahn-donald-trump-business-rivalry-partnership/2016/04/30/4cc69316-024a-11e6-9d36-33d198ea26c5_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">characterized</a> their association as highly competitive and centered more around business than friendship.</p>\n<p>“I’ve known him over the years, as an acquaintance. I like him,” the <em>Post</em> quoted Icahn as saying. “But I don’t see him all that much. I’m pretty much a workaholic.” Though Icahn served as an special adviser to the president on regulatory reform during the first half of 2017, he resigned the informal, unpaid position when <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/20/carl-icahn-resigned-from-trump-advisor-role-ahead-of-article-alleging-conflict-of-interest.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allegations</a> of conflicts of interest surfaced (Icahn denied the allegations). In a 1 March television <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/cnbc-transcript-icahn-enterprises-chairman-carl-icahn-speaks-with-cnbcs-scott-wapner-on-fast-money-halftime-report-today.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview</a>, Icahn said he hadn’t had much interaction with Trump “in the last four or five months.”</p>\n<p>Even so, Think Progress ran a follow-up article <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/carl-icahn-insider-trading-2bbd9561f9e6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quoting</a> Duke University law professor James D. Cox, an expert on insider trading, to the effect that the timing of Icahn’s stock sell-off “was ‘awfully suspicious’ and ‘unquestionably’ warrants a federal investigation”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Icahn would have material information even if Trump never had made up his mind he was going to impose the tariffs. There are cases out there that say, you know, look, if your privileged access gives you information that makes you a better person to judge the likelihood of an uncertain event, then that’s inside trading… So if Trump had some long conversation, or even a short conversation, with Icahn or in Icahn’s presence, talking about what are the upsides and downsides of this, that’s something that most people don’t know about, and Icahn would then be able to have a better insight of the possibility, if not likelihood, that Trump would impose these tariffs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>NPR <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590583598/before-trump-announced-tariffs-icahn-sold-off-millions-in-steel-related-stocks?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20180303\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> on 3 March that a White House spokesman had dismissed allegations that insider information was exchanged on the grounds that “Trump has long said both publicly and privately that he wanted to impose tariffs.”</p>\n<p>On 5 March, the nonpartisan watchdog group Project On Government Oversight (POGO) released a <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/our-work/letters/2018/pogo-asks-sec-to-investigate-carl-icahn-for-insider-trading.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a> calling on the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate Icahn for possible insider trading. </p>\n<p>On 7 March, Icahn categorically denied receiving advance notice of the tariff announcement in a terse <a href=\"http://carlicahn.com/statement-regarding-manitowoc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> posted on his web site (emphasis in the original):</p>\n<blockquote><p>We don’t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: <strong>Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration’s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue.</strong> We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A 23 February <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4150019-carl-icahn-just-cut-manitowoc-stake-33-percent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis</a> of Icahn’s Manitowoc sell-off by research analyst Matt Hogan characterized the company’s stock as overvalued and underperforming, and the company’s projected growth in comparison to its peer group as “mediocre.” Manitowoc’s share prices had been falling steadily since 26 January.</p>\n<p>Although there is <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">precedent</a> for pursuing insider trading charges against government officials and others who misappropriate nonpublic government information for profit, academic experts on insider trading told us that the evidentiary bar for proving that an illicit exchange of privileged information took place is quite high, making prosecution in a case like this, given what we know, unlikely. Moreover, the information in question pertained to a policy change with broad potential effects on entire industries. Insider trading charges more typically revolve around the misappropriation of so-called “material information” specific to particular companies and products. </p>\n<p>As of this writing, the SEC has not publicly responded to POGO’s demand for an investigation, and declined our invitation to comment on the matter.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/carl-icahn/\">Carl Icahn</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/donald-trump/\">donald trump</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/insider-trading/\">insider trading</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+3 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/steel/\">steel</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/tariffs/\">tariffs</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/\" class=\"author-link\">David Emery</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/new-york-ny-usa-april-19-408626140\" target=\"_blank\">lev radin / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">7 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Carey, Nick and Banerjee, Arunima.  “U.S. Steel, Aluminum Stocks Up on Trump’s Tariffs, but Other Industries Fear Price Rises.”<br>\n  <em>Reuters</em>.  1 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Deveau, Scott.  “Icahn Sold Down Stake in Steel-Linked Investment Before Tariffs.”<br>\n  <em>Bloomberg</em>.  2 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>DiChristopher, Tom and Rosenfeld, Everett.  “Carl Icahn Resigned from Trump Adviser Role Ahead of Article Alleging Conflict of Interest.”<br>\n  <em>CNBC</em>.  20 August 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Eltagouri, Marwa.  “Shortly Before Trump Announced Tariffs, His Former Adviser Dumped Millions in Steel-Related Stocks.”<br>\n  <em>The Washington Post</em>.  2 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Harwell, Drew.  “Inside the Rocky Bromance of Donald Trump and Carl Icahn.”<br>\n  <em>The Washington Post</em>.  30 April 2016.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Henning, Peter J.  “The Fine Line Between Political Intelligence and Insider Trading.”<br>\n  <em>The New York Times</em>.  8 April 2013.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hogan, Matt.  “Why Carl Icahn Just Cut His Manitowoc Stake by 33 Percent.”<br>\n  <em>Seeking Alpha</em>.  23 February 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Hohmann, James.  “The Daily 202: Trump Triangulates on Trade.

However, Harley said at the time that the decision was made to better serve the burgeoning market in southeast Asia, and that the decision would not affect manufacturing in the United States:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Thailand facility “will allow us to be more responsive and competitive in the ASEAN region and China,” Harley-Davidson public relations manager Katie Whitmore said.</p>\n<p>“Increased access and affordability for our customers in the region is key to growth for the company in total,” she said. “There is no intent to reduce H-D U.S. manufacturing due to this expansion.”</p>\n<p>The plant would let Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson avoid Thailand’s up to 60 percent tariff on imported motorcycles and help it get tax breaks when exporting to Thailand’s neighbors, thanks to a trade arrangement among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN).</p>\n<p>Harley opened a plant in India in 2011.

Additionally, a punitive, retaliatory tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles in any market would have a significant impact on our sales, our dealers, their suppliers and our customers in those markets.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/harley-davidson/\">harley davidson</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/manufacturing/\">manufacturing</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/motorcycles/\">motorcycles</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/tariffs/\">tariffs</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/st-petersburg-russia-august-8-2017-696301585\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Erofeenkov / Shutterstock.com</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">12 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bhattarai, Abha.   “U.S. Makers of Blue Jeans, Motorcycles and Other Goods Urge Caution on Tariffs.”<br>\n    <em>Washington Post</em>.   6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Barrett, Rick.   “Harley-Davidson Closing Kansas City Plant as Motorcycle Sales Fall.”<br>\n    <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>.   30 January 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Barrett, Rick.   “Harley-Davidson Closing Kansas City Plant as Motorcycle Sales Fall.”<br>\n    <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>.   30 January 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bogen, Julie.   “What’s the Deal with Steel?”<br>\n    <em>Vox</em>.   6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Helmore, Edward.   “Harley-Davidson: Trump’s Tariffs Pose Grave Threat to Famous American Name.”<br>\n    <em>The Guardian</em>.   10 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Reuters</em>.   “Harley-Davidson Plans a Thailand Factory to Serve SE Asian Market.”<br>\n    24 May 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Helmore, Edward.   “Harley-Davidson: Trump’s Tariffs Pose Grave Threat to Famous American Name.”<br>\n    <em>The Guardian</em>.   10 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "4K"},

The blog posts typically used <a href=\"http://archive.is/KiwkY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">language</a> intended to evoke strong emotions:</p><div id=\"snopes_skin_1x1\"></div>\n<blockquote><p><strong>A man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws.</strong> The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. <strong> Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual </strong>without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On 2 March 2018, officers <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/handgun-seized-in-belltown-under-extreme-risk-protection-order/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seized</a> a 31-year-old man’s handgun while serving him with an extreme risk protection order (often shortened to ERPO) requiring him to do so. Police said in a <a href=\"http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2018/03/02/seattle-pd-crisis-response-squad-serves-extreme-risk-protection-order-seizes-handgun/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> that the unidentified man had been the subject of “multiple calls” concerning his behavior.<br>\nBefore seizing his handgun, they said, the suspect had surreredered a shotgun to them in May 2017, after being served with an anti-harassment order. Police said he “acknowledged he was experiencing ‘stress’ and did not want it around.” A spokesperson said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Due to his numerous contacts with police and escalating behavior, SPD’s Crisis Response Squad filed for an Extreme Risk Protection Order, requiring the man to turn over all firearms. After the man failed to turn over his firearms or appear in court for a hearing on the order, police obtained a warrant and responded to the man’s apartment in the 2200 block of 2nd Avenue just after 1 p.m. on March 1st and took him into custody.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, many of these blogs misrepresented the statement, claiming that no warrants and no arrests were involved and ignoring the man’s failure to appear in court to address the protection order:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed2-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-131780 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed2-1.jpg?resize=600,106\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed2-1.jpg?w=600 600w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed2-1.jpg?resize=300,53 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-131781 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed1.jpg?resize=600,70\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed1.jpg?w=600 600w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/Seattle-gun-conspiracy-hed1.jpg?resize=300,35 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>A police spokesperson confirmed to us via email that the unidentified man had been reported for harassing people at a restaurant near his home, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The suspect in this case had been standing outside of the location while wearing a holstered pistol and threatening individuals exiting the premises, which in turn caused some people to be fearful that he might hurt them. This is a violation of law in Washinginton State. The man was taken into custody for his violation which ended in a warrant being issued by the judge for his arrest.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According</a> to state law:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It shall be unlawful for any person to carry, exhibit, display, or draw any firearm, dagger, sword, knife or other cutting or stabbing instrument, club, or any other weapon apparently capable of producing bodily harm, in a manner, under circumstances, and at a time and place that either manifests an intent to intimidate another or that warrants alarm for the safety of other persons.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the department spokesperson, the suspect — who lives directly above the restaurant — stood on a sidewalk in front of the business “yelling obscenities and accusing them of ‘talking to him through the floor.'” He later called officers back to the scene, saying that he could hear “taunting and voices” emanating from the restaurant. While meeting with police, they said, he said that he wanted a restaurant employee “arrested or shot.” He was detained and later taken to receive medical services.</p>\n<p>Sergeant Eric Pisconski, who heads the unit responsible for carrying out protection order-related seizures, <a href=\"http://mynorthwest.com/917703/spd-erpo-extreme-risk-protection-order/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> of the case:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We attempted multiple times to get the individual to fulfill that order of turning over their firearms. And he refused multiple times. We were forced, at that point, to take the next step in the ERPO law which is petitioning for a search warrant to go in and enter their home and remove the firearms from them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The involuntary gun seizure was reportedly the first of its kind, though not the first seizure overall, to be done under the auspices of the risk order, which was created by Initiative 1491, a Washington state ballot measure that was <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_Individual_Gun_Access_Prevention_by_Court_Order,_Initiative_1491_(2016)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">approved</a> by voters on 8 November 2016 and also called a “<a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-florida-school-school-shooting-red-flag-law-20180301-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">red flag</a>” law.</p>\n<p>The law allows for orders to be filed against a firearm owner by police or family members if they feel that the firearm owner “poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by having in his or her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm.” The law, which went into effect in 2017, states that confiscations conducted as a result of the orders may last a year.</p>\n<p>Washington is one of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/theres-something-states-can-do-about-gun-violence-red-flag-laws/2018/03/01/22ddf06c-1cc4-11e8-ae5a-16e60e4605f3_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">five states</a> with red flag laws.

In that regard, the bill places judges in the unenviable – indeed, impossible – position of trying to predict who may and may not become a mass murderer. Psychiatry and the medical sciences have not succeeded in this realm, and there is no basis for believing courts will do any better. The result will likely be a significant impact on the rights of many innocent individuals in the hope of preventing a tragedy.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"article-notation\"><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Update [8 March 2018]: Added comment from a Seattle police spokesperson.</p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"note\"><p>Update [9 March 2018]: Added more details provided to us by Seattle police.</p></blockquote></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-grab/\">gun grab</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/gun-rights/\">gun rights</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/guns/\">guns</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/seattle/\">seattle</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/second-amendment/\">second amendment</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/gun-on-table-571112788\" target=\"_blank\">Dzelaluddin / Shutterstock</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">7 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Updated:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 March 2018</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Michaud, Patrick. “Seattle PD Crisis Response Squad Serves Extreme Risk Protection Order Warrant, Seizes Handgun.”<br>\n<em>    Seattle Police Department.</em> 2 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Martin, Jonathan. “Handgun Seized in Belltown Under Extreme Risk Protection Order.”<br>\n<em>    Seattle Times.</em> 3 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Ballotpedia.</em> “Washington Individual Gun Access Prevention by Court Order, Initiative 1491 (2016).”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Kamp, Jon and Mahtani, Shibani. “States Consider Laws Allowing Courts to Take Guns From Dangerous People.”<br>\n    <em>Wall Street Journal.</em>  2 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>KIRO-FM.</em> “How Seattle is using ERPO laws to remove guns from at-risk people.”<br>\n    6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island.</em> “ACLU of Rhode Island Raises Red Flags Over ‘Red Flag’ Gun Legislation.”<br>\n    2 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "570"},

The image does not feature the Kray twins, it was not taken in 1960, and it does not show the beginnings of any sort of reign of terror, unless you have an unusual definition of the word. According to the caption provided by <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/hungry-elephant-high-res-stock-photography/HB6621-001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getty Images</a>, this <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/3377963/London-through-a-lens-Photography.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photograph</a> was taken in <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/hungry-elephant-high-res-stock-photography/HB6621-001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December 1936</a> on Grays Inn Road in London:</p>\n<blockquote><p>December 1936: An elephant stops a tram on Grays Inn Road, London, to cadge an apple from the driver.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s unclear when this image first became associated with a story about the Kray twins. This photograph has been accompanied by the erroneous caption since at least June 2016, when it was posted by the “<a href=\"https://archive.is/coUa9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pictures in History</a>” Twitter account. The caption also contains some misinformation about London’s trams. This photograph could not have been taken in 1960, as the tram system <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/6/newsid_2963000/2963092.stm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ended</a> in 1952 (it later returned in 2000):</p>\n<blockquote><p>1952: London’s trams trundle into history</p>\n<p>After nearly a century of service the tram has made its final appearance in London.</p>\n<p>The very last tram to rumble along the capital’s streets arrived at south-east London’s New Cross depot in the early hours of this morning.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This image has nothing to do with the Kray twins, but it did make us wonder: Did Reggie and Ronnie Kray really use elephants to terrorize London tram riders? No, not that we can tell.  No in-depth look at their lives or careers that we were able to find made any mention of pilfering pachyderms. </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/bad-history/\">bad history</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/elephants/\">elephants</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/fauxtography/\">fauxtography</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+2 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/kray-twins/\">kray twins</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/london/\">london</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/\" class=\"author-link\">Dan Evon</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">7 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>BBC</em>.   “London’s Trams Trundle into History.”<br>\n    6 July 1952.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Moreton, Cole.   “Legend: An In-Depth Look Into the Violent History of Ronnie and Reggie, the Kray Twins.”<br>\n    <em>The Independent</em>.   29 August 2015.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "44"},

Amazon responded to the creepiness today in a statement to The Verge, saying, “We’re aware of this and working to fix it.”</p>\n<p>… Amazon said its planned fix will involve disabling the phrase, “Alexa, laugh,” and changing the command to “Alexa, can you laugh?” The company says the latter phrase is “less likely to have false positives,” or in other words the Alexa software is likely to mistake common words and phrases that sound similar to the one that makes Alexa start laughing. “We are also changing Alexa’s response from simply laughter to ‘Sure, I can laugh,’ followed by laughter,” an Amazon spokesperson said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Additional <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/debug/amazon-alexa-laughing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">articles</a> referenced subsequent requests for Alexa to turn on the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/amazon-laugh-alexa-echo-voice-fix-update-strange-skills-problem-bug-a8245156.html?utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lights</a>, which depending on enunciation and dialect can sound like a command to “laugh”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Amazon said in a statement that it’s aware of the issue and on rare occasion, Echo speakers can mistakenly hear “Alexa, laugh.” Basically, the speaker is hard of hearing.</p>\n<p>The company intends to fix the problem by changing the wake phrase to a less-demanding “Alexa, can you laugh?” which it claims will result in less false positives.</p>\n<p>“We are also changing Alexa’s response from simply laughter to ‘Sure, I can laugh,’ followed by laughter,” an Amazon spokesperson told Bloomberg.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We contacted an Amazon representative to ask about the Alexa glitch, but it seemed that reports of “random” creepy laughing stemmed mostly from misinterpreted requests to turn on a “lamp” or lights.

For one thing, Bachmann did not appear on “Fox &amp; Friends”<em> </em>on either 2 March 2018 or 3 February 2018. Neither of the official Twitter accounts for either <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=fox%20from%3Amichelebachmann&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bachmann</a> or “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=bachmann%20from%3Afoxandfriends&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox &amp; Friends</a>“<em> </em>promoted or mentioned such an appearance. We also searched the show’s <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/search?q=bachmann\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web site </a>and the IMDB pages for the episodes on the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt8055442/?ref_=ttep_ep61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aforementioned</a> <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7941674/?ref_=ttep_ep34\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dates</a> and found no record of Bachmann’s alleged visit.</p>\n<p>None of that was strictly necessary, as this meme contains a watermark for the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/C4MB18.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> page “Christians for Michele Bachmann,” a satirical group that <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/christians-for-michele-bachmann/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">frequently</a> mocks her for her religious beliefs. However, we couldn’t find this particular meme on the “Christians for Michele Bachmann” Facebook page. We did find a similar meme using the same format and color scheme, but the included fictional quote involved Roy Moore, not assault rifles:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bachmann-quotes.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-131920\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bachmann-quotes.jpg?resize=600,526\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bachmann-quotes.jpg?w=960 960w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bachmann-quotes.jpg?resize=300,263 300w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/bachmann-quotes.jpg?resize=768,674 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The earliest version of the fake “assault rifles” quote that we could find was posted to another political satire Facebook page, “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ReallyPoliticked/photos/a.398231337048228.1073741828.398229917048370/738440409693984/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Politicked</a>,” on 5 March 2018. That page is categorized as “just for fun” and states in its “About” section that it creates “left wing political satire with original and biting memes.”</p>\n<p>It’s unclear if “Politicked” created the assault rifle meme (using a template from Christians for Michelle Bachmann) or if they reposted the meme after the original was deleted.

No, Rizvi is not a right-wing extremist.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The YourNewsWire.com piece is based on an April 2017 <a href=\"https://archive.is/OI9v0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> by the Gatestone Institute, a right-wing think tank that uses extremist language to describe an alleged Muslim takeover of London. (We use the term “based” lightly here, as YourNewsWire.com<em> </em>simply wrote a few of their own fear-mongering paragraphs before producing a near-verbatim copy of the Gatestone post.) In their piece, Gatestone uses shoddy research and cherry-picked data — including the claim that London is home to 423 “new” mosques and that 500 of the city’s churches have closed since 2001. </p>\n<h3><strong>423 New Mosques?</strong></h3>\n<p>For their “new”<strong> </strong>mosque claim, Gatestone used a map of mosques in London from <a href=\"http://mosques.muslimsinbritain.org/maps.php#/mosque/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MuslimsInBritain.org</a>, a blog dedicated to cataloging British mosques<strong>.</strong> Yet the map itself doesn’t claim to be a catalog of “new” mosques, and a number of mosques included on the map were built well before the year 2000. The <a href=\"https://www.finsburyparkmosque.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Finsbury Park Mosque</a>, for instance, was built in the 1990s, and the <a href=\"https://www.finsburyparkmosque.org/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leytonstone Mosque</a> was constructed in 1976.</p>\n<p>While YourNewsWire.com and Gatestone both sought to create the impression that large cathedral-like mosques are being “built on the ruins of Christianity,” many British mosques are small communities that meet in converted houses or buildings. According to MuslimsInBritain.org, the majority of mosques in the United Kingdom are small <a href=\"http://www.muslimsinbritain.org/resources/masjid_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">establishments</a> with fewer than 300 members. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> A 2012 report in </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/a-history-of-mosques-in-britain/8629263.article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ArchitectsJournal.com</a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> also noted that the majority of mosques in Britain are not purpose-built structures: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>There is no definitive figure for how many mosques there are in Britain today, although the best estimate is in the region of 1,500. Of these, approximately 200 are purpose-built, the rest being either converted houses or other non-residential conversions.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>500 Closed Churches? </strong></h3>\n<p>Gatestone’s claim that 500 churches have closed since 2001 is also based on shoddy research. The number comes from a 2012 <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324001104578163303753632508\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wall Street Journal</a> </em>article<em> </em>about a British trend of converting old churches into private homes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although it’s still relatively rare in the U.S., the adaptive reuse of churches has become a popular practice in other countries, like the U.K. In 2006, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found that since 2001, about <strong>500 churches in London alone had been converted into homes.</strong> In other countries, such as Germany and Russia, people still regard the concept of living in a church as disrespectful, says Bart Kellerhuis of Utrecht-based firm Zecc Architects, which has done several church-to-home conversions in the Netherlands.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, what the article did not say was <em>when</em> these churches had actually closed, meaning that some of the converted churches may have closed prior to 2001. <span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">The figure also excludes any churches that have closed since 2001 that were </span><em style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">not</em><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"> converted into houses.</span></p>\n<p>The figure also doesn’t account for how many churches in London have opened their doors since 2001. <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/st-johns.college/research/fellows/peterbrierley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Peter Brierley</a>, a leading expert on British religious statistics and author of the report <em>UK Church Statistics</em>, found that London saw 700 new <a href=\"https://faithsurvey.co.uk/download/csintro2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">churches</a> between 2005 and 2012, and that the total number of churches in the United Kingdom actually increased between 2008 and 2013:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/church-numbers.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-131779\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/church-numbers.jpg?resize=600,206\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/church-numbers.jpg?w=551 551w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/church-numbers.jpg?resize=300,103 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>While the overall numbers are only changing slowly, the actual number of churches increased between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to continue between 2013 and 2020. Why is this? The answer comes in two broad ways. There are 600 more Pentecostal churches in the UK than 5 years ago, the large majority being new black churches, of which the RCCOG is the largest denomination.</p>\n<hr><p>The Black Majority Churches’ [BMCs] “explosion” has been significant, especially in Greater London where of the 700 new churches which began between 2005 and 2012, at least 400 were BMCs.

And although some of the individuals in this photograph may indeed be carrying a weapon (most likely the police officers), there is not one single definitive image of a gun. It was actually taken in Boston in August 2011, when DeGeneres was in the city to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theellenshow/status/101305254188032001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promote</a> her show:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A mob of dancing and screaming Ellen DeGeneres fans showed up at Faneuil Hall on Aug. 10 to see the beloved daytime talk show host tape promos for her new time slot. DeGeneres, who will take over Oprah Winfrey’s 4 p.m. hour on WCVB-TV Channel 5, spent the morning seeing the sights from a Boston Duck Tours boat, then danced for the thousands of fans who showed up at Quincy Market to welcome her to town. By her side was wife Portia DeGeneres, known professionally as Portia de Rossi. Some may also remember the “Arrested Development” actress from the series “Ally McBeal,” which just so happened to be about a fictional Boston law firm.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Boston.com has several other <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/ae/celebrity/gallery/ellendegeneresboston/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">images</a> of the event. The blog Carrots &amp; Cake, which also <a href=\"https://carrotsncake.com/2011/08/ellen-degeneres-in-boston.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documented</a> the event, credited the image used in this meme to Twitter user @Kafranklin21, but it appears that the original image has been removed. </p>\n<p>This claim, then, was made up out of the whole cloth by disreputable web sites attempting to smear DeGeneres as a hypocrite.

As a report <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/2018/pdf/trad1217.pdf#page=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released</a> by the Commerce Department shows, the actual deficit is $566 billion:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/US-trade-deficit-chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-132034 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/US-trade-deficit-chart.jpg?resize=600,441\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/US-trade-deficit-chart.jpg?w=600 600w, https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/US-trade-deficit-chart.jpg?resize=300,221 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The report said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The 2017 increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of $57.5 billion or 7.6 percent to $810.0 billion and a decrease in the services surplus of $3.7 billion or 1.5 percent to $244.0 billion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A report <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ERP_2018_Final-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> by the White House in February 2018 stated that the U.S. economy has become more dependent on trade involving “private service-producing industries” such as engineering, travel, and finance among others:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Travel (including that for educational purposes) has constituted the largest share of U.S. services exports. Services trade between countries has continued to grow — given declining travel costs, improvements in telecommunications, and growth in online services that allow, for example, computer coding to take place in remote locations. This allows the United States to export high-skilled services to other countries that do not share our<br>\nexpertise and training advantages.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Focusing on trade of tangible goods alone, the report added, ignored the country’s “comparative advantage” in service-related trade.</p>\n<p>Trump reiterated his misleading claim on the same day he officially <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/08/politics/tariff-donald-trump-national-security/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">imposed</a> tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum, respectively. Mexico and Canada — the country’s partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement — are exempted from those tariffs, and other countries will be allowed to petition for separate exemptions. The president’s plan to impose the tariffs led to the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/585786755/white-house-economic-adviser-gary-cohn-quits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resignation</a> of White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn on 6 March 2018.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-will-exempt-canada-and-mexico/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that the tariffs will take effect on 23 March 2018.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/economics/\">economics</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/global-trade/\">global trade</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/trump-administration/\">trump administration</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/united-states/\">united states</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/arturo/\" class=\"author-link\">Arturo Garcia</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/8567825104/\" target=\"_blank\">Gage Skidmore / FLICKR</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Qiu, Linda. “President Trump’s Exaggerated and Misleading Claims on Trade.”<br>\n    <em>New York Times.</em> 6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Associated Press.</em> Fact Check: Is Trump Right About the Size of Trade Deficit?”<br>\n    Accessed via CBS News. 8 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Liptak, Kevin and Diamond, Jeremy. “US Allies are Upset.

This rumor appeared to originate with viral screenshots from an Instagram post of indeterminate origin:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">the juul wave is ~over~ <a href=\"https://t.co/FcP4pMqNNw\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/FcP4pMqNNw</a></p>\n<p>— matea cannavino (@mateacannavino) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mateacannavino/status/961315769417166848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">February 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>According to the screenshots, four students in total have received terminal or otherwise dire diagnoses attributed specifically to their use of JUUL products. Aside from the mention of two universities (USC and LSU), the only available detail was that a 19-year-old man purportedly was “diagnosed with lung cancer” and his “lungs [were] completely black.”</p>\n<p>This rumor comes with no supporting evidence, incidental or otherwise. Dr. Kien Vuu, professor of medicine at UCLA-David Geffen School of Medicine, <a href=\"https://thetab.com/us/2018/02/08/juul-cancer-74529\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">addressed</a> the plausibility of specific claims that at least four people had developed lung cancer by JUULing for a relatively short period of their lives:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is unlikely that ‘Juuling’ has a short term carcinogenic effect which would cause cancer so early in these young people. It usually takes a lag time from an exposure of a carcinogen before cancer ensues.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Research into the long-term effects of e-cigarette use is ongoing, but David Levy, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi, said of <a href=\"https://gumc.georgetown.edu/news/E_Cigarettes_Can_Help_Smokers_Quit_But_Theres_a_Catch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data</a> published in mid-2017:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our findings are consistent with randomized trials and those observational studies that measure frequency of e-cigarette use. These results support the use of e-cigarettes — especially, consistent use — as an effective smoking cessation aid. Since e-cigarettes are generally estimated to have a small proportion of the mortality risks of cigarettes, this represents an important life-saving intervention that doctors can recommend when other forms of treatment fail.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Levy referenced a <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3262?utm_source=Global+Health+NOW+Main+List&amp;utm_campaign=a301cda732-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_07_26&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8d0d062dbd-a301cda732-876207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> (“E-cigarette use and associated changes in population smoking cessation: evidence from US current population surveys”) published by <em>BMJ</em> on 26 July 2017.</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\">Laws about minimum age for tobacco purchases vary between states.

For some existing customers, this may mean changes to your account or delivery experience. Warranties will continue to be honored for JUUL devices purchased at retail or online for customers who are of legal age in their state.</p></blockquote>\n<p>JUUL posted a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/juul/comments/7w0mf6/official_juul_update/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> addressing the rumor:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The claim circulating on social media that individuals’ friends “have been diagnosed with cancer as a direct result of the JUUL” is unsubstantiated and reckless. For all our customers, partners and employees that are on our important mission with us to improve public health, know that we will protect the company and our customers and take legal action as appropriate.</p>\n<p>At JUUL Labs, we care deeply about our customers. Many people in the company and their friends use JUUL as well, so we include ourselves as our customers. We are a mission driven company seeking to eliminate cigarettes by providing a true alternative for adult smokers.</p>\n<p>JUUL incorporates important technological advances and best practices which include the following; First, JUUL is temperature regulated to minimize the emissions of combustion-related degradation products. Second, we do not add chemicals of concern on key FDA lists such as formaldehyde as ingredients. (Note that nicotine, while on these lists, is included in our product to facilitate switching for adult smokers.) Third, independent third party laboratories have conducted validated analytical tests on the aerosol contents of JUUL and we are excited to present these results within the SRNT scientific forum at the end of this month.</p>\n<p>The best decision is to never start smoking or initiate nicotine-containing products. We stand by our mission to serve as a true alternative to combusted cigarettes for adult smokers. We will continue to respond as necessary to unfounded allegations.</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"snopes-partner-unit partner-unit-articleFooter\">\r\n    <div class=\"snopes-partner-media\">\r\n        <div id=\"Snopes_content_1\" adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\"[[300,250]]\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"article-info-box\">\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"feedback-and-sources \">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" data-modal-content=\"#modal-feedback\" data-modal-type=\"dom\" class=\"nohash btn-feedback call-modal ev-track ajax-modal\" rel=\"ajaxmodal\" data-lightbox-title=\"Send Feedback\" data-lightbox-title-icon=\"fa fa-envelope-o\" title=\"Send Feedback\" data-ev-track=\"social, email, send-feedback\">Feedback</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#feedback\" class=\"nohash btn-sources\">Sources</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"tag-box\"><span class=\"label\">Filed Under:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/cancer/\">cancer</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/juul/\">juul</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/juuling/\">juuling</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#show-all-tags\" class=\"show-all-tags nohash\">+1 more</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/tag/social-media-panics/\">social media panics</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Fact Checker:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/author/kim/\" class=\"author-link\">Kim LaCapria</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Featured Image:</span><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Juul_in_hand.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Mylesclark96 / Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"label\">Published:</span><span class=\"date-wrapper\">9 March 2018<span></span></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article-sources-box\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Sources:</span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Zhu, Shu-Hong et. al.   “E-Cigarette Use And Associated Changes In Population Smoking Cessation: Evidence From US Current Population Surveys.”<br>\n    <em>BMJ</em>.   26 July 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Georgetown University Medical Center</em>.   “E-Cigarettes Can Help Smokers Quit, But There’s A Catch.”<br>\n    31 August 2017.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>JUUL</em>.   “JUUL Age Policy.”<br>\n    Accessed 6 March 2018.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"additional-articles additional-articles-post additional-articles-footer\"><div class=\"header\"><h3 class=\"title\">More From Snopes.com</h3><div class=\"loading-results\"><i class=\"fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw\"></i><h5 class=\"loading-msg\">Loading...</h5></div></div></div>\n\t</div>"], "share_count": "244"}
